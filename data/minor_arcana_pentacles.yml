overview: |
  The Pentacles in the Minor Arcana symbolise the entire domain of material life: 
  body, health, money, and worldly resources. They emphasise tangible reality as 
  both a gift and a challenge. From the Ace (where matter reveals the seed of 
  spiritual unity) to the Ten (where earthly cycles reach completion), Pentacles 
  remind us that material existence can be a sacred path—provided we let its 
  lessons transform us rather than enslave us.

suit: "Pentacles"

cards:
  - number: "Ace"
    name: "Ace of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Material potential"
      - "Health"
      - "Resources"
      - "Lotus of matter"
      - "Infinite possibility"
    interpretations: |
      The Ace of Pentacles signifies an abundant wellspring of physical and 
      material potential. It can foretell wealth, robust health, and tangible 
      prospects, yet also invites us to spiritualise matter and to discover 
      the divine seed within the material world. Negatively, it cautions 
      against an obsession with possessions or a lack of grounding in practical 
      affairs.
    description: |
      Commonly illustrated lying horizontally (unlike the more vertical Aces of 
      Swords, Cups, Wands), the Ace of Pentacles evokes humility and the 
      transformative capacity inherent in matter. Often depicted with a flower 
      (like a lotus) at its centre, it suggests that from the mud of the earthly 
      plane can spring the “diamond” of consciousness.
      
      Three concentric circles or rings typically represent the outer garden of 
      earthly concerns, a middle zone reflecting the practical, and an inner 
      red circle symbolising divine essence. In some depictions, the red centre 
      contains a cross or four petals, pointing to the four cardinal elements 
      of matter. Alchemists saw this as a promise that by materialising the 
      spirit (and spiritualising matter), humankind could discover the 
      philosopher’s stone.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ace of Pentacles suggests new opportunities in finances, 
      career, or bodily well-being. It hints at undiscovered potential in the 
      physical world that can flower into spiritual fulfilment if nurtured.  
      Turn your attention to practicality, yet remain open to the divine spark 
      hidden in mundane reality.
    monologue: |
      "I lie close to the earth, holding a secret seed. Within my stillness dwells 
      a sacred gem—material wealth waiting to be awakened. Honour me with wise 
      stewardship, and the flower of spirit shall bloom from the soil of matter."

  - number: "Two"
    name: "Two of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Unfinalised contract"
      - "Preparation"
      - "Balancing resources"
      - "Transition from past to future"
      - "Infinite ribbon"
    interpretations: |
      The Two of Pentacles represents a state in which a financial or material 
      agreement has not yet crystallised—anticipation is high, but outcome 
      remains uncertain. It could be forging a new partnership, bridging 
      yourself and an investment, or finalising a work deal. Negatively, 
      it may show reluctance to commit, whimsical handling of practical 
      affairs, or a danger of perpetual indecision.
    description: |
      Often illustrated by two large coins connected by a ribbon or infinity 
      sign, the card highlights the potential synergy—and tension—of joining 
      two separate circles. Some depictions add dates or references that imply 
      passage from older frameworks (death) to the domain of creation (the 
      eternal or the divine). 
      
      The sinuous line that weaves between the pentacles symbolises growth, 
      a continuity that can transform matter into something higher. 
      Its numerological hints (like 13 for transformation and 26 for 
      divinity) emphasise that the path from old to new is both an 
      inner and outer process.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Two of Pentacles suggests you are juggling financial 
      or bodily concerns, working on an as-yet unfinished deal, or preparing 
      to commit. Manage your affairs calmly—turn your potential stress 
      into a dance that propels you forward instead of weighing you down.
    monologue: |
      "I glide between two worlds, binding them with a living thread. 
      Embrace my playful balance, for I can lift you into fresh prosperity 
      if you dare to finalise your wavering steps."

  - number: "Three"
    name: "Three of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "First returns"
      - "Uncertain gains or losses"
      - "Collaboration"
      - "Material venture"
      - "Risky beginning"
    interpretations: |
      The Three of Pentacles indicates the birth of a material project or 
      partnership. It might be an initial investment yielding its first 
      profits—or losses. It symbolises the impetus to transform resources 
      into tangible outcome, be it a business, a building, or the literal 
      formation of new life in the womb. If negative, it warns of hasty 
      gambles, false starts, or fiascos from ill-prepared schemes.
    description: |
      Commonly, three coins are shown in a triangular arrangement, 
      emphasising how the synergy of two can produce something new. 
      Leaves or sprouts sometimes appear, symbolising the uncertain 
      fruits. The outcome is not predetermined; it largely depends 
      on wise caretaking, as well as luck.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Three of Pentacles calls you to nurture your 
      material beginnings. Manage the risk with diligence—fledgling 
      endeavours need knowledge and careful tending to flourish. 
      Adopt patience, but do not be too timid to act.
    monologue: |
      "I am your first step into the world’s marketplace— 
      uncertain, yes, but brimming with creative chance. 
      Invest mindfully, or risk sowing seeds to be lost 
      on barren ground."

  - number: "Four"
    name: "Four of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Material stability"
      - "Security"
      - "Routine"
      - "Health"
      - "Tight control"
    interpretations: |
      The Four of Pentacles shows the mastery of resources and 
      finances, a protective domain ensuring daily subsistence. 
      Physical well-being or consistent income is implied. 
      Such security fosters strong foundations but can also 
      breed stagnation if one clings too tightly, refusing 
      to let money or energy circulate. 
    description: |
      Often depicted with a phoenix or a central emblem (perhaps 
      referencing the mythical bird renewing itself by fire), 
      the Four of Pentacles reminds us that every stable 
      structure encloses impermanence. Prosperity endures 
      only if it flows rather than being locked away in 
      pure accumulation.
    reading: |
      In a spread, this card can be a sign of stability or 
      consolidation—like a secure job, a healthy body, or 
      reliable family support. But it also warns: 
      be generous, remain flexible. Do not let protective 
      instincts freeze you into possessiveness or short-sighted 
      caution.
    monologue: |
      "I am the fortress of your wellbeing, the calm vantage 
      of sufficiency. Let me ground you, but never imprison you; 
      no vault stands forever if life’s stream is cut off."

  - number: "Five"
    name: "Five of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "New ideal in matter"
      - "Bridge between old and new"
      - "Spirituality in the physical"
      - "Risk of swindles"
      - "Temptation or aspiration"
    interpretations: |
      The Five of Pentacles conjures a moment when solid 
      material security confronts a bold new vision—be it 
      ecological consciousness, altruistic business, or 
      an invention bridging matter and spirit. It is 
      the impetus to lift financial or bodily concerns 
      onto a higher plane. 
      
      Negatively, illusions, betrayal, or self-delusion 
      can occur if the “ideal” is a lure. 
      One might gamble away resources on unfounded 
      promises.
    description: |
      Visually, the four corners typically hold pentacles 
      signifying established reality, while a central 
      symbol stands for the emergent vision that yearns 
      to break free. Leaves or lines may show a transitional 
      impetus from old constraints to new realms. 
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Five of Pentacles challenges you 
      to elevate everyday life with an ideal or to invest 
      in something that benefits more than just yourself. 
      But watch for illusions—scrutinise big promises 
      before leaping.
    monologue: |
      "Upon the solid earth I raise a dream, calling you 
      to transform your mundane assets into the seeds 
      of a higher calling. Yet walk with caution— 
      not all shining roads lead to honest lands."

  - number: "Six"
    name: "Six of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Material pleasure"
      - "Prosperity"
      - "Sharing wealth"
      - "Embodied joy"
      - "Risk of self-indulgence"
    interpretations: |
      The Six of Pentacles symbolises a joyous union with 
      bodily or financial abundance—like a satisfying flow 
      of salary, successful enterprise, or contentment in 
      one’s health. In the best sense, it fosters generosity, 
      encouraging you to share surplus with others. 
      
      Negatively, it can turn into vanity or narcissistic 
      enjoyment that excludes broader compassion. It may 
      also speak of illusions that money alone solves 
      every problem.
    description: |
      Often, six pentacles appear in a pleasing arrangement 
      with bright leaves or symmetrical patterns, reflecting 
      a balanced material life. If the layout looks too 
      closed in on itself, it suggests a self-absorbed 
      bubble that fails to reach beyond its own comfort.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Six of Pentacles invites you to 
      relish your physical or financial blessings. However, 
      you are also asked to consider the needs of the 
      community—wealth or wellness are best sustained 
      through generosity and empathy.
    monologue: |
      "Feel the warmth of plenty coursing through your hands; 
      let it lift your spirit. Yet do not lock the doors— 
      feast well, but remember your neighbours hunger for 
      life’s sweetness too."

  - number: "Seven"
    name: "Seven of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Action of spirit in matter"
      - "Work for humanity"
      - "Generosity"
      - "Alchemical synergy"
      - "Danger of exploitation"
    interpretations: |
      The Seven of Pentacles highlights how resources 
      or business can blend with higher principles— 
      philanthropy, enlightened commerce, or a holistic 
      approach to the body. If well-guided, it fosters 
      success that benefits not just the self but the 
      collective. 
      
      Yet exploited by greed, it may turn to rapacious 
      behaviour, such as multinational predators 
      ravaging ecosystems or a neglectful caretaker 
      draining health from the body.
    description: |
      Typically, seven pentacles form a central triangle 
      (the mind/spirit) within a framing square (earthly 
      realism). This geometry indicates the intellect 
      or soul acting dynamically upon physical reality. 
      Abundance is possible, but success ties intimately 
      to ethics and compassion.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Seven of Pentacles advises you 
      to invest your resources (time, health, money) 
      with a spiritual or humanistic dimension. Combine 
      realistic planning with genuine altruism—then 
      you can find a synergy that elevates all around you.
    monologue: |
      "I channel your highest aims into the soil of 
      the real. Will you sow life-giving seeds or 
      devour the earth in short-sighted profit? 
      I hold potential for grand works— 
      choose the path that honours all."

  - number: "Eight"
    name: "Eight of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Abundance"
      - "Harmonious world"
      - "Perfect balance"
      - "Physical prosperity"
      - "Danger of overindulgence"
    interpretations: |
      The Eight of Pentacles represents the full bloom 
      of material success—health, wealth, order— 
      where the synergy of body and environment thrives. 
      This card can point to paradise on earth, a family 
      or enterprise that runs smoothly, a stable job, 
      or an eco-friendly approach to life. 
      
      Yet if the caretaker grows complacent or exploitative, 
      trouble lurks. Even perfection must keep evolving, 
      or it may collapse from rigidity.
    description: |
      Often arranged in two squares of four pentacles 
      or a symmetrical figure, the Eight evokes 
      completeness and a dynamic equilibrium reminiscent 
      of mother nature’s tapestry. Leaves or a central 
      cross can emphasise the universal harmony.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Eight of Pentacles heralds 
      material and bodily equilibrium. If you act 
      responsibly, you can sustain it. If not, 
      even great success can tarnish. 
      Stay humble, keep refining what you have, 
      and share your bounty.
    monologue: |
      "I offer you a flourishing oasis, ripe with 
      life and ease. Tend it faithfully—no garden 
      remains perfect if the gardener forgets 
      the changing seasons."

  - number: "Nine"
    name: "Nine of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Birth or crisis"
      - "Potential shift"
      - "Inheritance or major loss"
      - "Material metamorphosis"
      - "Emerging new dimension"
    interpretations: |
      The Nine of Pentacles stands at the threshold 
      of an old cycle’s end and a new beginning. 
      It may symbolise literal birth (a baby’s head 
      appears from the womb), or figurative birth 
      like a fresh job, winning a lawsuit or lottery, 
      or a forced move following financial ruin. 
      This crisis is both destruction and creation, 
      a release from stagnation.
    description: |
      Commonly, the arrangement of nine coins forms 
      an oval or womb-like shape with a central pentacle 
      emerging as though it were a child’s head. 
      Leaves or lines may show the flux from stable 
      perfection (eight) to sudden transformation (ten). 
      Everything waits for the final push to cross 
      into new terrain.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Nine of Pentacles suggests 
      an imminent change in your material situation— 
      it could be an inheritance, a pregnancy, 
      a new business, or the collapse of an old structure, 
      all opening a door to an uncharted reality.
    monologue: |
      "Standing at the womb’s brink, I bear your old 
      world to its radical renewal. Will you lament 
      the passing or rejoice in fresh breath? 
      My labour can be painful, but life must ever 
      press forward."

  - number: "Ten"
    name: "Ten of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Completion of a cycle"
      - "Material legacy"
      - "Awaiting spiritual next step"
      - "Imprisonment if clung to"
      - "Gateway to new realm"
    interpretations: |
      The Ten of Pentacles completes the material cycle 
      with a sealed totality of wealth or earthly success. 
      Four coins in the corners anchor it, while the 
      remaining six form an oval or mandorla in the centre. 
      This culminating form can be liberating if you 
      let it lead to the next stage (like the Ace of Wands, 
      or Swords). If greed or fear keeps you here, you 
      become trapped.
    description: |
      Often, a white axis or bridging line is depicted, 
      linking two pentacles at the top or bottom, 
      pointing to a transition beyond mere matter. 
      You have reached the maximum of your current 
      worldly journey. The question remains: 
      will you evolve or freeze?
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ten of Pentacles speaks of a 
      finalised legacy—like a comfortable retirement, 
      a family fortune, or stable business. But 
      it also invites you to let go and move forward 
      so that new growth (Ace of Wands or Swords) 
      may emerge.
    monologue: |
      "I present your earth-bound story’s grand finale— 
      wealth, health, or all you once craved. Yet 
      I yearn to open another door. Release me and 
      ascend, or clutch me till your treasure 
      turns to shackles."
