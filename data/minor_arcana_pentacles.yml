overview: |
  The Pentacles symbolize material life in all its dimensions: body, health, money, 
  worldly resources, and family. This suit is essentially receptive, demonstrating 
  how matter can be a sacred teacher if we cultivate it rather than dismiss or 
  obsess over it. From the Ace’s raw, unformed potential to the Ten’s culmination, 
  each card shows how stability can cycle into transformation, urging us not to 
  let prosperity or daily life stagnate.

  Numerologically, Aces present the germ of material existence, Twos juggle 
  embryonic contracts, Threes risk a new venture, Fours create stable domains, 
  Fives seek higher ideals in the material plane, Sixes revel in shared prosperity, 
  Sevens commit resources to altruistic or exploitative ends, Eights manifest 
  fullness, Nines mark crisis and rebirth, and Tens achieve completeness 
  that must be used for a higher calling.

suit: "Pentacles"

cards:
  - number: "Ace"
    name: "Ace of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Material energy in potential"
      - "Seed of prosperity"
      - "Bodily well-being"
      - "Humble power"
      - "Risk of denial or obsession"
    interpretations: |
      The Ace of Pentacles signifies the raw potential of physical existence: 
      body, resources, territory, and the grounding influence of material reality. 
      It does not advocate rejecting or fetishizing matter; instead, it suggests 
      matter as a path to self-discovery and spiritualization.

      Numerologically, the Ace represents the “last shall be first,” 
      since the Pentacles lie horizontally. Properly acknowledged, 
      it reveals hidden riches in health, finances, or bodily 
      consciousness. Mishandled, it degenerates into greed, 
      illness, or neglect.
    description: |
      The card shows a Pentacle close to the ground, bearing the potential 
      for growth like a lotus rising from mud. It carries a “diamond of 
      consciousness” at its core, implying that from the humility of 
      daily life springs universal awareness. This underscores how 
      matter, properly engaged, can reach sacred heights.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ace of Pentacles invites you to see fresh 
      possibilities in your physical or financial realm. Embrace 
      the resources at hand, and remember that hidden within the 
      mundane is a blueprint for greater wholeness.
    monologue: |
      “I lie on the earth, simple yet harboring infinite potential. 
      Honor my material ground, and watch it blossom into 
      the diamond of spirit.”

  - number: "Two"
    name: "Two of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Unfinalized contract"
      - "Embryonic phase"
      - "Balancing resources"
      - "Potential partnership"
      - "Instability or whimsy"
    interpretations: |
      The Two of Pentacles references a phase where financial 
      or bodily commitments remain unfinished. It might be the 
      beginning of a business plan, home construction, or 
      a decision about health or investment. The outcome is 
      not yet determined.

      Numerologically, Twos are about “receptive accumulation.” 
      In Pentacles, the material realm seeks union or synergy 
      but is still in flux. Failure to commit can lead to 
      endless juggling with no firm outcome.
    description: |
      Two Pentacles appear to be circling or linked by a 
      unifying ribbon, suggesting the desire for synergy. 
      Crawling creatures may adorn the base, symbolizing 
      primal matter that needs transformation. This 
      condition is neither fully formed nor stable.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Two of Pentacles suggests you may be 
      balancing multiple material concerns. Decide how to 
      finalize deals, handle finances, or address bodily 
      needs. Hesitation prevents progress.
    monologue: |
      “I float between the old and the new, an unsealed pact. 
      Bring me to completion, or watch my promise slip 
      into indecision.”

  - number: "Three"
    name: "Three of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "First returns"
      - "Uncertain gains or losses"
      - "Material gamble"
      - "Risky beginning"
      - "Fertile collaboration"
    interpretations: |
      The Three of Pentacles indicates an initial material project 
      yielding its first results. Profit or loss is equally possible. 
      It may represent a business venture, the first sprout of a 
      new job, or literal conception in the womb.

      Numerologically, Threes unleash “creation or destruction.” 
      In Pentacles, it translates to uncertain investments that 
      require diligent care to mature. Hasty optimism or 
      under-preparation can sabotage success.
    description: |
      Three Pentacles form a triangular arrangement that points 
      upward, signaling the birth of a new enterprise. The top 
      Pentacle appears in an emerging structure, hinting at 
      uncertain but promising fruit. 
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Three of Pentacles encourages careful 
      nurturing of a fledgling undertaking. Risk is high, 
      but so is potential. Focus your efforts; do not 
      abandon the seeds you have planted.
    monologue: |
      “I am your tentative step into the world of matter. 
      Tend me faithfully or gamble me away. 
      Growth or demise rests in your hands.”

  - number: "Four"
    name: "Four of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Material stability"
      - "Security and routine"
      - "Physical well-being"
      - "Risk of stagnation"
      - "Need for circulation"
    interpretations: |
      The Four of Pentacles highlights a secure domain: consistent 
      finances, bodily health, or a stable home. Yet at the center 
      lies perpetual transformation, symbolized by the phoenix 
      that renews itself through fire. Security becomes lethal 
      if it refuses ongoing change.

      Numerologically, Four is the square—strong and stable. 
      If stability fossilizes, it robs life of vitality. 
      Regular maintenance and generosity keep resources 
      from decaying.
    description: |
      Four Pentacles at the corners form a protective border, 
      but the phoenix in the center burns eternally to remind 
      us that life feeds on dynamic exchange. A locked vault 
      grows stale; open circulation fosters renewal.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Four of Pentacles advises you to 
      appreciate your present security yet remain flexible. 
      Invest, share, and adapt so you do not stagnate 
      in a closed loop of material comfort.
    monologue: |
      “I am the fortress of your material life, safe yet prone 
      to the slow rot of complacency. Tend my fire, 
      or watch my walls crumble in time.”

  - number: "Five"
    name: "Five of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Bridge to new ideals"
      - "Investment in higher goals"
      - "Temptation or aspiration"
      - "Risk of swindles"
      - "Spiritualizing matter"
    interpretations: |
      The Five of Pentacles shows the moment stable resources 
      confront a new vision—clean energy, organic practices, 
      moral or spiritual expansions. It can signal investing 
      money or energy in something that transcends pure profit. 
      The danger is naive illusions or swindles.

      Numerologically, Five is “temptation.” In Pentacles, 
      it invites you to raise everyday material matters 
      toward a broader ideal or philanthropic cause, 
      but illusions can produce setbacks.
    description: |
      Four Pentacles anchor the corners, while a fifth in 
      the center rises to indicate a higher vantage. 
      The partial opening at the center suggests 
      a call beyond routine. 
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Five of Pentacles urges you to 
      explore an ideal that elevates your resources 
      or bodily care. Scrutinize possibilities to 
      avoid false promises. Genuine aspiration 
      can transform your material realm.
    monologue: |
      “I open a door in your solid world, beckoning you 
      to reach beyond mere safety. Will you cross 
      into a grander vision, or be seduced 
      by false gold?”

  - number: "Six"
    name: "Six of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Pleasure in matter"
      - "Generosity"
      - "Prosperity shared"
      - "Enjoyment of the body"
      - "Risk of vanity"
    interpretations: |
      The Six of Pentacles indicates a harmonious engagement 
      with the physical plane. Money flows, health is robust, 
      and enjoyment is sincere. This can lead to generosity 
      and open-handed sharing of blessings. However, 
      overindulgence or vanity may grow if one 
      becomes enamored with appearances.

      Numerologically, Six represents beauty. For Pentacles, 
      this means the sensual or aesthetic fullness of 
      embodiment. True beauty extends outward, 
      uplifting others as well.
    description: |
      Six Pentacles form a pleasing arrangement, 
      reflecting balanced prosperity. Leaves or 
      shapes suggest a flourishing of bodily 
      or financial well-being. When closed in 
      on itself, it becomes narcissistic 
      self-enjoyment.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Six of Pentacles brings good news 
      regarding money, health, or comfort. Revel in 
      enjoyment without forgetting that an open heart 
      magnifies blessings for all.
    monologue: |
      “I enfold you in the sweetness of the world—taste, 
      touch, contentment. Yet do not lock me away 
      in vanity, for the greatest joy is found 
      in open-handed living.”

  - number: "Seven"
    name: "Seven of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Action within matter"
      - "Spiritual seeds"
      - "Altruistic success"
      - "Union of body and spirit"
      - "Risk of voraciousness"
    interpretations: |
      The Seven of Pentacles depicts the highest level 
      of material engagement, where money or bodily 
      health serves more than just the self. This can 
      be philanthropic business, spiritual endeavors 
      that uplift society, or unselfish use of 
      personal resources. 

      If twisted, the same power fosters greed or 
      multinational exploitation. Numerologically, 
      Seven is intense action; in Pentacles, 
      that action is either blessing or devouring 
      the world.
    description: |
      Several Pentacles create a structure that frames 
      a triangle of elevated purpose within a 
      stable square, symbolizing spirit 
      acting in matter. 
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Seven of Pentacles invites you 
      to invest in ways that benefit humanity as well 
      as your own life. Evaluate whether you are 
      building a better world or fueling selfishness.
    monologue: |
      “I am the fusion of spirit and matter, urging you 
      to build a legacy that blesses many. Wield resources 
      wisely, lest your power devour itself in empty greed.”

  - number: "Eight"
    name: "Eight of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Balanced abundance"
      - "Complete harmony"
      - "Prosperity and health"
      - "Shared well-being"
      - "Risk of imbalance"
    interpretations: |
      The Eight of Pentacles manifests true material harmony, 
      where resources, body, and home function together. 
      All needs are met, and the environment thrives in 
      synergy. This can be an established family, 
      a well-run business, or a personal life 
      in perfect equilibrium.

      Negatively, taking this harmony for granted can 
      let decay slip in. Overlooking maintenance 
      or community can unravel success.
    description: |
      Eight Pentacles form a symmetrical arrangement 
      that exhibits fullness and healthy flow. 
      A central flower or symbol radiates stability. 
      This image conjures paradise on Earth 
      if maintained properly.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Eight of Pentacles 
      praises your balanced approach to finances, 
      health, or domestic life. Enjoy what 
      you have built. Ensure you remain attentive, 
      since blissful stasis can fade when neglected.
    monologue: |
      “I bring you a vision of the world in balanced bloom. 
      Partake in my riches, but know that only vigilant 
      care preserves my bounty.”

  - number: "Nine"
    name: "Nine of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Crisis in matter"
      - "Birth of a new phase"
      - "Inheritance or transformation"
      - "Precautions needed"
      - "Risk of mishandling change"
    interpretations: |
      The Nine of Pentacles suggests the end of one 
      material cycle and the imminent birth of a new one. 
      This might mean literal pregnancy, a shift in wealth, 
      or a transition in health or resources that requires 
      careful handling.

      Numerologically, Nine is active and receptive, 
      indicating crisis or change. If well-managed, 
      it yields a fresh start in the material plane; 
      if bungled, it leads to sudden collapse 
      or missed opportunity.
    description: |
      Nine Pentacles, with one often in a “womb-like” 
      arrangement, signal an impending event—a child, 
      a new business, or a reorientation of fortune. 
      Branches forming an oval or protective shape 
      highlight the necessity for care.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Nine of Pentacles advises 
      you to handle big material changes prudently. 
      These transitions—positive or negative—carry 
      high stakes. Thoughtful action can transform 
      crisis into renewal.
    monologue: |
      “I herald the end of one worldly chapter and the fragile 
      dawn of the next. Walk gently, for in this moment 
      a single slip can shatter or exalt your future.”

  - number: "Ten"
    name: "Ten of Pentacles"
    keywords:
      - "Completion of material cycle"
      - "Wealth awaiting a calling"
      - "Earthly totality"
      - "Invitation to the next element"
      - "Risk of stagnation"
    interpretations: |
      The Ten of Pentacles depicts the ultimate fruition 
      of material pursuits. A stable home, solid finances, 
      or enduring health fill the picture. This totality, 
      however, begs the question: will these riches or 
      comforts remain idle or be offered to a higher 
      cause?

      Numerologically, Ten finishes the cycle but 
      also hints at transformation. Embrace 
      a greater purpose, or sink into static 
      self-satisfaction.
    description: |
      Ten Pentacles form a completed mandala. The “white axis” 
      or new line passing through them indicates that 
      prosperity is ready for a shift into another domain, 
      possibly the creative or spiritual realm.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ten of Pentacles confirms 
      a robust conclusion to your material journey, 
      at least in its present stage. Reflect on 
      how you will use these resources. 
      Hoarding or complacency wastes 
      the cycle’s hard-won lessons.
    monologue: |
      “I complete the circle of your worldly gains, 
      a treasure brimming with unsung purpose. 
      Do you hold me still, or shall I become 
      the root of something yet grander?”
