# minor_arcana_swords.yml

overview: |
  The Swords in the Minor Arcana symbolise the entire realm of intellectual life and the Logos. 
  From the Ace (the raw potential of thought) through the Ten (the culmination and transformation), 
  each card illustrates a distinct stage in the evolution of mind. At its most elevated, this 
  evolution leads to a contemplative emptiness (in the Eights) or a unitive clarity (in the Tens). 
  However, the path of Swords may also involve fanaticism, paralysis, conflict, or crisis of 
  understanding if misapplied. Ultimately, the journey invites the adept to balance reason with 
  receptivity, forging a flexible but unshakeable intellect.

suit: "Swords"

cards:
  - number: "Ace"
    name: "Ace of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Great intellectual potential"
      - "Mental capacity"
      - "Discernment"
      - "Victory by clarity"
      - "Verbal power"
    interpretations: |
      The Ace of Swords represents immense intellectual potential, a new surge of mental clarity, 
      and the capacity for decisive thought. It is akin to the Ten of Wands in that it signals a 
      powerful transition for the intellect, moving from raw potential into direct action. 
      
      In a positive sense, it can signify victory through intelligence, cunning, or sheer 
      intellectual determination. Negatively, it may manifest as verbal aggression, overestimation 
      of the mind’s abilities, or a dismissive attitude toward the material realm.
    description: |
      Depicted as a single blade — often piercing a crown — the Ace of Swords highlights 
      the power of clear, incisive thought to overcome confusion. Symbolically, it conveys 
      the journey from unstructured mental energy to refined decisiveness. By grasping the sword, 
      one chooses discernment and resolve over uncertainty and chaos.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ace of Swords heralds a breakthrough in mental focus: an opportunity 
      to cut through doubts. It encourages taking a stand based on logic and reason. If negative 
      influences surround it, beware of harsh words or a dogmatic tendency to ignore emotional 
      nuance.
    monologue: |
      "I am the first spark of pure reason. Grasp my hilt and let your thoughts shine like a 
      newly forged blade, sweeping aside all confusion with lucid certainty. Yet use my power 
      with care—words can heal or harm, and the intellect untempered by compassion becomes a 
      double-edged sword."

  - number: "Two"
    name: "Two of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Accumulation of ideas"
      - "Preparation"
      - "Mental hesitation"
      - "Passive intellect"
      - "Daydream"
    interpretations: |
      The Two of Swords signifies a receptive state of mind in which numerous ideas collect without 
      yet being put into action. It is a phase of gathering knowledge or formulating plans. This 
      intellectual passivity can be beneficial—granting you time to reflect—or it can lead to 
      procrastination or an inability to choose a course. 
      
      Negatively, it points to a lazy mind, indecision, or being stuck in daydreams without 
      forward progress. People under its influence may hop from one topic to another, never 
      settling on a definitive outcome.
    description: |
      Commonly illustrated with a large central flower of eight petals, the Two of Swords evokes 
      a mind brimming with unrealised potential. The swords crossing or interlacing indicate 
      dual perspectives or multiple paths, waiting for a decisive break.
    reading: |
      In a spread, this card advises patience and further thought. Although mental resources 
      are plentiful, you must organise or refine them to avoid drifting aimlessly. Once you 
      clarify your aim, the mind’s latent energy can be harnessed for concrete results.
    monologue: |
      "I am the pause before action, where thoughts swirl in a calm spiral. Embrace my stillness— 
      gather your wits, weigh the possibilities—then let a single, decisive intention emerge."

  - number: "Three"
    name: "Three of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Fanatic intellectual burst"
      - "Immature thought"
      - "Mental enthusiasm"
      - "Impulsive ideas"
      - "First opinions"
    interpretations: |
      The Three of Swords refers to the intense, almost fanatical emergence of primary ideas and 
      first opinions. This can be a highly creative or fervent stage, where the mind leaps from 
      mere daydream to initial action. However, it also risks fanaticism, confusion between 
      believing and knowing, or a lack of follow-through.
    description: |
      Often depicted with three swords or vivid shapes that evoke an upsurge of mental energy, 
      the card underscores a dynamic shift from passive reflection (seen in the Two) toward 
      urgent expression. Enthusiasm dominates here, but so does the potential for scattered 
      or ill-considered reasoning.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Three of Swords invites you to harness your excitement responsibly. 
      Directed well, it can lead to innovation; unchecked, it may foster impulsive decisions 
      or zealotry. Self-awareness is crucial in preventing a brilliant start from fizzling out.
    monologue: |
      "I am the wild spark of new ideas—unrestrained, passionate, and raw. Burst forth in 
      creation if you dare, but remember: unanchored fervour can blind you to reality’s limits."

  - number: "Four"
    name: "Four of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Intellectual stability"
      - "Rationalism"
      - "Mental organisation"
      - "Conservative mind"
      - "Practical thought"
    interpretations: |
      The Four of Swords indicates an intellect settling into structure, forging a balanced, 
      methodical approach to problem-solving. This is the rational mind—capable of interacting 
      with material life clearly and effectively. Yet if left unchecked, it might become staid, 
      overly conservative, or closed to intuition.
    description: |
      Depictions typically emphasise calm and order: the swords may be arranged in a resting 
      pattern, conveying a well-structured mental framework. While necessary for stability, 
      such structure can stifle creativity if it becomes rigid.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Four of Swords advises practical, grounded thinking. Now is a time to 
      solidify plans and approach challenges with a well-organised strategy. Watch for signs 
      of mental inflexibility or rationalist arrogance.
    monologue: |
      "I provide the calm vantage point from which your thoughts settle into clarity. Yet if 
      you cling too tightly, order hardens into a cage. Embrace discipline, but let wonder 
      breathe beneath the surface."

  - number: "Five"
    name: "Five of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Emerging viewpoint"
      - "New ideal"
      - "Conflict of perspectives"
      - "Intellectual transformation"
      - "Possible cynicism"
    interpretations: |
      The Five of Swords depicts the entrance of a fresh perspective or ideal that challenges 
      the old. The mind begins shifting, sometimes clashing with established beliefs. This can 
      be a marvellous evolution of thought—yet cynicism or duplicity may also ensue, particularly 
      if new insights disturb entrenched loyalties.
    description: |
      Imagery often shows the swords interlaced with a revealing gap above or around the central 
      blade, symbolising a newly uncovered intellectual path. The tension between old stability 
      and new possibility can be productive or fracturing, depending on one’s openness.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Five of Swords suggests a new vision stirring in your intellectual world. 
      Be mindful of potential conflicts with those unwilling to adapt. Handled with honesty, 
      this shift can lead to greater clarity and personal growth.
    monologue: |
      "My fresh insight cuts through your older views—embrace or resist, the change is here. 
      If you yield gracefully, your mind transcends old limits. If you hold tight to illusions, 
      I may wound more than I enlighten."

  - number: "Six"
    name: "Six of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Joy in thought"
      - "Refinement"
      - "Peaceful transition"
      - "Poetry"
      - "Intellectual beauty"
    interpretations: |
      The Six of Swords ushers in intellectual pleasure and gentle refinement. Having begun 
      to integrate new ideas (in the Five), the mind now appreciates the beauty of well-ordered 
      thought, sometimes in near-poetic forms. However, self-absorption or aesthetic elitism 
      can arise if caution is neglected.
    description: |
      Visual depictions might suggest a calm crossing—some symbolise a serene voyage or 
      arrangement of swords that reflect poetic symmetry. This hush of mind fosters 
      imaginative depth and measured thinking.
    reading: |
      When the Six of Swords appears, it implies a tranquil shift toward more elegant, 
      contemplative thought. Embrace the grace in your intellectual pursuits, but avoid 
      distancing yourself from practical realities or the opinions of others.
    monologue: |
      "Savour the simple joy of thought grown subtle and clear. Let me show you the soft 
      gleam of each well-formed idea—yet remember, too, that beauty shared is lovelier 
      than beauty hoarded."

  - number: "Seven"
    name: "Seven of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Highly active mind"
      - "Receptive intellect"
      - "Stepping outward"
      - "Service to others"
      - "Possible misuse of knowledge"
    interpretations: |
      The Seven of Swords denotes an intellect that is both active and newly receptive, bridging 
      internal insight and external engagement. It can mark self-transcendence and a desire to 
      serve. On the darker side, knowledge might be weaponised or used for self-serving ends.
    description: |
      The artwork frequently shows a prominent blue sword or a pivotal blade that hints 
      at meditative clarity, now directed outward. The mind, no longer content with 
      introspection alone, may yearn to share or impose its insights.
    reading: |
      In a spread, the Seven of Swords advises focusing your mental prowess on beneficial pursuits. 
      Seek to uplift rather than dominate. Keep watch for any temptation to manipulate facts 
      for personal advantage.
    monologue: |
      "I have discovered the power beyond my own walls. Through me, your mind can heal 
      or harm. Choose integrity, for intellect fused with compassion reshapes the world 
      in uplifting ways."

  - number: "Eight"
    name: "Eight of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Intellectual perfection"
      - "Emptiness"
      - "Deep meditation"
      - "Void"
      - "Potential block"
    interpretations: |
      The Eight of Swords symbolises the pinnacle of intellectual receptivity—true emptiness. 
      In this profound meditation, dualities vanish, and a near-Buddhist realisation of 
      voidness arises. The negative side is mental blockage, fear of letting go, or an 
      inability to function in daily life if one clings exclusively to emptiness.
    description: |
      Often shown with minimal external flourish, the Eight of Swords highlights the serene 
      state of a mind stripped of extraneous concepts. Yet the blankness can be either 
      illuminating or paralysing, depending on perspective.
    reading: |
      In a reading, this card indicates that you stand on the verge of an extraordinary 
      inward breakthrough. Embrace the silence, but remember to remain lovingly connected 
      to external reality.
    monologue: |
      "I am the hushed centre, where words dissolve into luminous quiet. Let go of all 
      self-concepts, and you shall glimpse the infinite within. Yet do not flee the 
      living world—emptiness is a gate, not a home."

  - number: "Nine"
    name: "Nine of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "New understanding"
      - "Breaking old habits"
      - "Intense crisis"
      - "Mental uncertainty"
      - "Approaching illumination"
    interpretations: |
      The Nine of Swords portrays the decisive fracture of outdated thought patterns, heralding 
      a fresh clarity. It often aligns with crisis: fear, depression, or mental upheaval 
      can accompany the final shedding of illusions. 
      
      Nonetheless, this metamorphosis paves the way for enlightenment—when old concepts 
      shatter, new insight blooms.
    description: |
      Imagery generally emphasises a sword (or swords) in motion, sometimes with cracks 
      indicating the collapse of entrenched mental walls. The emphasis is on resolutely 
      facing the pain of transformation.
    reading: |
      In a spread, the Nine of Swords indicates that whilst you may be weighed down by 
      anxiety or heartbreak, a breakthrough is imminent. If you let the crisis run its 
      course, renewed clarity will follow.
    monologue: |
      "I am the dreaded hour when illusions crumble. Dare to face my darkness, for 
      with each fragment of thought you cast aside, the mind stands closer to liberation."

  - number: "Ten"
    name: "Ten of Swords"
    keywords:
      - "Completion of transformation"
      - "Intellectual maturity"
      - "Dual blades"
      - "Androgynous unity"
      - "Freedom from self"
    interpretations: |
      The Ten of Swords signifies the culmination of the Swords cycle. Instead of one blade, 
      there are now two—feminine and masculine, or receptive and active—meeting in harmonious 
      union. This is full intellectual maturity, where the mind transcends personal bias and 
      integrates the viewpoint of the Other.
      
      Negatively, it can point to failure to adapt or the refusal to accept new mental 
      unifications. Conflict arises if the subject cannot reconcile differences.
    description: |
      Typically illustrated with two swords exiting or transcending a boundary (often an oval), 
      the Ten of Swords affirms that limitations have been surpassed. It is the intellect 
      freed from its old shell, poised to explore reality unbound.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ten of Swords proclaims that an intellectual cycle has ended. You are 
      invited to stand firm in your newly gained wisdom and press onward, no longer chained 
      by old assumptions. This is both an ending and a potent new beginning.
    monologue: |
      "I am the final chord of thought’s grand symphony. Where once there was only one 
      perspective, now there are two, seamlessly entwined. Embrace the fullness of your 
      hard-won insight and step into the world reborn."
