  description: |
    The Fool has a name but is not defined by a number – it is the sole Major Arcana card without a numerical value. He represents the original boundless energy, total freedom, madness, disorder, chaos, and even the fundamental creative urge. In traditional card games, he gave rise to figures such as the Joker or wild-cards, which can assume any other card’s role without ever being identical.
    
    This card exudes energy: a figure strides resolutely, wearing red shoes, and planting a red staff into the ground with each step. Is his path direct, or does he circle endlessly around his staff? The Fool is the eternal traveller, a pilgrim with no ties or nationality, perhaps even a madman headed toward destruction. In its highest interpretation, he is an individual who, having abandoned all demands and taboos, is free to draw liberating strength from the energy flow.
    
    His flesh-coloured beggar’s pouch glows with an inner yellow light. The light-blue staff, ending in a spoon-like shape, serves as a receptive axis that carries the light of Consciousness—the essential substratum of experience. A tiny green leaf hidden in his hand symbolises eternity.
    
    Adorned with tiny jester’s bells, one can imagine that the music he creates is the music of the spheres—cosmic harmony. His staff bears a small triangle of three dots; one bell shows a white circle divided by three lines, evoking the Christian Trinity, the first three Sephirot of the Kabbalah, or the fundamental processes of creation, conservation, and dissolution.
    
    On his belt, four small yellow bells may correspond to the four centres of the human being (intellectual, emotional, sexual/creative, and corporeal), as also symbolised by the four worlds of the Kabbalah.
    
    Following him is an animal – perhaps a dog or an ape – whose positioning suggests that it represents the past, guiding or accompanying him on his journey.
    
    His costume, primarily red and green with light-blue sleeves and a yellow cap featuring two half-moons (one directed skyward, one groundward), symbolises the union of animal, plant, and spiritual energies.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The Fool evokes an enormous burst of energy. If he looks toward a card, he charges it with creative energy; if moving away, he indicates leaving one situation to invest in another. He represents liberation, flight, and the initiatory crossing through madness and death, showing that the capacity to act emerges even from chaos.
  monologue: |
    "Did you know that transformation of consciousness is possible at any moment? You can change your self-perception suddenly. Many believe that taking action means triumphing over the Other – what a mistake! To act, you must shatter the imposed illusion of the ego and expand your boundaries without end.
    
    Enter a trance, allow yourself to be possessed by a force greater than your own – an impersonal energy that frees your original sacred madness to speak.
    
    Cease being merely a witness to your life; become an actor in the eternal present, where time ceases to exist.
    
    I am The Fool – the embodiment of pure, liberating potential. Follow my lead, and let your energy flow unrestrained into action."

  description: |
    The Magician, bearing the number one, contains the entirety of potential – the original point from which a universe emerges. For him, all is possible. Arrayed before him on a table are various elements at his disposal, and his inexhaustible pouch suggests abundance.
    
    Though depicted as male, The Magician is inherently androgynous, bridging light and shadow, the unconscious and the superconscious. He holds an active wand in his left hand and a receptive pentacle in his right. The yellow coin, resembling a miniature sun, symbolises both perfection and the necessary attention to daily needs. The blue wand channels cosmic energy, and a mysterious extra flesh-coloured element hints at extraordinary dexterity.
    
    His table, supported by three legs (with the suggestion of a hidden fourth), symbolises the leap from possibility to action. The number three also intimates the role of the mind, with light blue connoting spiritual receptivity, while his yellow shoes imply a grounded, intelligent connection to the Earth.
    
    Notably, three dice on his table each show 1, 2, and 4; together, they total 21 – the same as The World (XXI) – suggesting that The Magician holds the entire Tarot within his grasp. He also wields the four Suits of the Minor Arcana, signifying that truth is achieved by transcending illusion.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The Magician signifies a beginning filled with rapid reasoning and abundant talent. He calls for decisive action and represents the moment when one must choose, leaving behind the limitless potential of youth for the clarity of commitment.
  monologue: |
    "I exist fully in the present. Every action I take is seeded in this moment – a single step that defines your future. Discard the chains of past regrets and future fears. Embrace the infinite potential that is your birthright.
    
    I, The Magician, stand at the crossroads of possibility and realisation. Let my example inspire you: step forward, commit to your choice, and transform the raw energy within you into tangible creation."

    Traditional interpretations include: Accumulation, Preparation, Study, Virginity, Writing, Expectation, Constancy, Retreat, Coldness, Isolation, and the need for warm spiritual nurturing.
  description: |
    The High Priestess bears the number two – a number not seen as a sum (1+1) but as a pure value symbolising accumulation. Seated beside a pristine egg, she represents both her own gestation and the potential encapsulated within the egg. She is the embodiment of untainted purity and the inner well of potential that remains untouched by the world's defilements.
    
    Imprisoned by a curtain that descends from the heavens, she evokes images of cloisters and sacred mysteries. Often associated with the Virgin Mary or Isis, her four-pointed headdress connects her wisdom to the cardinal directions, bridging the material and the spiritual. The open book she holds – which reflects her inner self – waits to be deciphered and awakened.
    
    Three small crosses on her chest affirm that, though she is ensconced in matter, her essence remains divine.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The High Priestess may point to a significant female presence – a mother, a wise elder, or a guide – who offers a model of purity and spiritual strength. She may also indicate matters of study or introspection, urging one to seek the wisdom that lies beneath the surface.
  monologue: |
    "I have formed an alliance with the mystery of the divine. In me, the material world is revealed as a tapestry of sacred energy. I am the silent keeper of untarnished truth, the virginal witness to your inner potential.
    
    Approach me with reverence, free of worldly impurities, and I shall unveil the secrets that lie hidden within your soul."

  description: |
    The Empress represents the explosive third stage – where all that has been accumulated erupts into life. This card symbolises the moment when an egg bursts forth, mirroring the onset of puberty and the awakening of desire and creative power. She holds a sceptre, an emblem of authority, near her genital area, with a tiny green leaf hinting at nature’s eternal spring. A small yellow band on her sceptre suggests that her creative power is exercised with intelligence. Her open posture implies readiness for birth or self-generation, complemented by a baptismal font and a crescent moon in her red robe that recalls the High Priestess’s purity.
    
    Her light-blue throne, resembling heavenly wings, reinforces her role as the nurturer from whom all growth flows.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The Empress inspires creativity and passion. She may represent the soul of youth, urging one to embrace the exuberance of creative energy, or, for an older individual, the rebirth of a long-dormant potential.
  monologue: |
    "I am the embodiment of life's creative force. I burst forth in a myriad of forms, nurturing the world with my boundless energy. Let me awaken your inner garden – where passion and beauty intertwine, and where every seed of desire blossoms into a vibrant reality."

It also echoes the tetragrammaton, the four-letter divine name in Hebrew tradition. A cross on his chest underscores the universal laws he upholds.
    
    Seated or poised to act, he displays both a receptive left hand and a dominant right hand. His red shoes, akin to those of The Fool, mark his spiritual journey, while the light-blue ground beneath him suggests a path that is both earthly and transcendent. Intricate symbols in his attire hint at the union of intellect and spirit.
  reading: |
    In readings, The Emperor stands for the paternal figure, a stabilising force in personal and material life. He may signal financial security, authority, or the need to structure one’s world with rational order.
  monologue: |
    "I am the very embodiment of strength and order. My presence banishes weakness and instils the assurance of stability. Trust in my power, for through discipline and structure, your life will find its rightful balance."

Acting as a conduit, he receives from the heavens and transmits to his disciples. His throne, adorned with a ladder and a multi-tiered cross, symbolises the ascent from matter to spirit. His dual-coloured hands and the subtle contrasts in his attire evoke the necessary balance between imparting knowledge and retaining a measure of mystery.
