  description: |
    Strength, the first card of the second decimal series and numbered eleven, opens the path for unconscious energies. Whereas The Magician works from the waist upward, Strength channels energy from the waist downward, embracing the primal forces of nature. Her hat, reminiscent of the infinity symbol, and the unique details in her posture – including a single visible foot with six toes – underscore her role as the mediator between instinct and conscious will.
  reading: |
    In a reading, Strength suggests the emergence of vital energy and the need to reconcile inner animal impulses with higher conscious goals. It often relates to issues of sexual expression or the need to harness raw power for creative ends.
  monologue: |
    "I am the threshold of untamed energy. From the depths of instinct, I rise to meet the light of consciousness. Embrace your inner wildness, for it is the very spark that ignites transformation. Let my strength guide you to channel your primal force into creative, life-affirming action."

  description: |
    The Hanged Man, corresponding to the second degree of the second decimal series, is depicted suspended upside down by a rope. His immobilised posture – with one leg extended and the other bent, and his hands crossed behind him – symbolises a deliberate halt. This suspension is akin to a foetus preparing to leave the womb, marking a crucial pause for internal realignment.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The Hanged Man advises that the moment for action is not yet ripe. It calls for introspection, meditation, and the acceptance of necessary delay before progress can resume.

  description: |
    The Devil, though originally linked to the fifth degree of the first decimal series, appears here as a force that draws one into the depths of the subconscious. With bat wings and a torch (with a green handle) in hand, his image combines human and animal elements. Multiple eyes on his face reveal his desire to confront hidden fears, and while he is associated with negative traits such as deceit and dependency, he also symbolises the potent creative energy that can be harnessed when one faces one’s inner darkness.

    The Tower represents the collapse of outdated structures. Its imagery of a tower—symbolic of the body—being bathed in a purifying light suggests that destruction is not merely punitive but liberatory. Rather than depicting absolute ruin, it shows figures engaged in a dynamic, almost celebratory release as old paradigms crumble to reveal the fertile ground for new growth.
  reading: |
