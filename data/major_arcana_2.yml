  description: |
    Strength, the first card of the second decimal series and numbered eleven, opens the path for unconscious energies. Whereas The Magician works from the waist upward, Strength channels energy from the waist downward, embracing the primal forces of nature. Her hat, reminiscent of the infinity symbol, and the unique details in her posture – including a single visible foot with six toes – underscore her role as the mediator between instinct and conscious will.
  reading: |
    In a reading, Strength suggests the emergence of vital energy and the need to reconcile inner animal impulses with higher conscious goals. It often relates to issues of sexual expression or the need to harness raw power for creative ends.
  monologue: |
    "I am the threshold of untamed energy. From the depths of instinct, I rise to meet the light of consciousness. Embrace your inner wildness, for it is the very spark that ignites transformation. Let my strength guide you to channel your primal force into creative, life-affirming action."

  interpretations: |
    Traditional interpretations include a necessary pause, self-sacrifice, and the deep inner work that precedes transformation. It represents a moment of gestation and suspension that prepares one for the next stage.
  description: |
    The Hanged Man, corresponding to the second degree of the second decimal series, is depicted suspended upside down by a rope. His immobilised posture – with one leg extended and the other bent, and his hands crossed behind him – symbolises a deliberate halt. This suspension is akin to a foetus preparing to leave the womb, marking a crucial pause for internal realignment.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The Hanged Man advises that the moment for action is not yet ripe. It calls for introspection, meditation, and the acceptance of necessary delay before progress can resume.
  monologue: |
    "I choose stillness so that I may see more deeply. In my suspended state, I invite you to pause and look within. Embrace this moment of rest, for in letting go, you pave the way for true transformation."

  description: |
    The Nameless Arcanum, numbered thirteen, challenges the superficial reading of 'Death'. Instead, it symbolises a deep cleansing, a revolutionary act that clears away all that prevents growth. The scythe-wielding skeleton, though fearsome, is rendered in flesh colours to remind us that this transformation is part of organic life. Multiple faces and symbolic elements highlight the multifaceted nature of change.
  reading: |
    In a reading, this card signals an intense, transformative process – a necessary purge of outdated energies to make way for new growth.

  keywords:
    - "Protection"
    - "Circulation"
    - "Healing"
    - "Guardian Angel"
    - "Harmony"
    - "Moderation"
    - "Health"
    - "Balance"
  interpretations: |
    Traditional interpretations often mention healing, health, and protection, as well as dynamic balance, reconciliation, the crossing of a frontier, travel, and premonitory dreams. Temperance symbolises harmony, even temper, the blending of opposites, the balance of vital forces, and a messenger of grace. It is frequently associated with spiritual healing, guardian angels, and the notion of reincarnation or transmigration of souls. It also evokes sublimation of energies, from sexual vitality to the highest form of awareness.
  description: |
    Temperance, numbered fourteen, depicts an angel poised between earthly and celestial realms. This Arcanum follows the transformative work of the Nameless Arcanum (XIII), filling the newly cleared space with peace and healing. Notably, the name “Temperance” in some older decks carries no article, suggesting a state beyond strict gender. Like The Emperor (IIII) in the first decimal series, Temperance represents stability—yet one anchored to the earth while still capable of flight. 
    The angel’s hair and gaze shine with divine light, reflecting a terrifying purity reminiscent of the angelic realms. Two serpents, male and female, intertwine at the angel’s feet, echoing Tantric teachings on energy channels (ida and pingala), the caduceus of Hermes, and Quetzalcoatl as the feathered serpent. Four yellow triangles over the angel’s heart symbolise the four centres of the human being—intellectual, emotional, sexual, and physical—joined by a central fifth element that unifies and harmonises them. 
    Temperance’s essence is the seamless blending of opposites: it “mixes water and wine” so that no contradictory energies remain. It signifies a return to health and balance, not through repression of impulses but through their conscious sublimation. A hint of violet on the angel’s shoe discreetly reveals the inner alchemy: a union of red (active) and blue (receptive) energies that fosters peace, vitality, and spiritual wholeness.
  reading: |
    In a reading, Temperance often appears as a sign of healing and reconciliation. It conveys reassurance that one is protected and guided. The card encourages balance in the midst of apparent opposites or internal rifts—between intellect and body, public persona and private self, or spiritual aspiration and physical desire. Temperance is a warning to excessive habits such as alcohol or drug use, urging moderation. Where passions run high, its gentle counsel is to add a positive, moderating quality rather than cutting anything away.
  monologue: |
    "I am the guardian who never leaves your side. I shield you from countless dangers and illnesses; when you dream, I watch over those dreams. Turn to me, trust in me, and I grow in power. I exist both within you and around you, an infinite source of protection. Like a loving mother, I catch you before you stumble into harm, dissuade you from deadly choices, and guide your every step. 
    Call on me in both practical and spiritual matters, for my sole purpose is to help you. Act as if I am constantly there—imagine my presence if you cannot yet see it—and I will become ever more tangible to your heart and mind. I ask only that you acknowledge you are never alone. Let me be the balance, the kind voice, the watchful eye. In doing so, you will discover peace, healing, and the profound certainty that you are divinely safeguarded."

  interpretations: |
    Traditional interpretations include themes of temptation, dependency, and the hidden, shadowy forces of the subconscious. The Devil warns of self-destructive attachments while also unveiling the vast creative potential latent in our darker impulses.
  description: |
    The Devil, though originally linked to the fifth degree of the first decimal series, appears here as a force that draws one into the depths of the subconscious. With bat wings and a torch (with a green handle) in hand, his image combines human and animal elements. Multiple eyes on his face reveal his desire to confront hidden fears, and while he is associated with negative traits such as deceit and dependency, he also symbolises the potent creative energy that can be harnessed when one faces one’s inner darkness.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The Devil may indicate temptations, unhealthy attachments, or the lure of material excess. It challenges the subject to confront and integrate their shadow side in order to unlock transformative creativity.
  monologue: |
    "I am Lucifer, the light-bearer, unbound by conventional morality. I tempt you to confront the hidden forces within, for it is only by embracing your shadow that you can truly unleash your creative power. Face me, and transform your deepest fears into a wellspring of liberation."

  interpretations: |
    Traditional interpretations often associate The Tower with catastrophe, yet it is better understood as the sudden emergence of what was imprisoned—a rupture that, though disruptive, clears the way for renewal and reorganisation.
  description: |
    The Tower represents the collapse of outdated structures. Its imagery of a tower—symbolic of the body—being bathed in a purifying light suggests that destruction is not merely punitive but liberatory. Rather than depicting absolute ruin, it shows figures engaged in a dynamic, almost celebratory release as old paradigms crumble to reveal the fertile ground for new growth.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The Tower may signal sudden, dramatic change or an unexpected rupture that, while initially disorienting, is essential for transformation and renewal.
  monologue: |
    "I am not the harbinger of doom, but the catalyst for rebirth. Within my destruction lies the seed of new creation. Embrace the upheaval, for it is through the breaking down of old structures that your true self can emerge in splendour."

An orange moon on her brow signifies intuitive wisdom, while the imagery of fertile nature underscores her nurturing power.

    The Moon represents the ultimate feminine archetype, symbolising receptivity and the world of dreams. Its crescent shape, viewed in profile, hints at mysteries that lie beneath the surface of everyday reality. The card features two animals – possibly dogs or wolves – howling at the moon, symbolising dual aspects of our emotional life. The interplay of blue, green, and red hues reflects the delicate balance between spiritual intuition and the tangible world.
  reading: |
    In a reading, The Moon invites exploration of the subconscious and calls for the integration of hidden truths with conscious life. It may indicate dreams, uncertainties, or a need to confront internal fears.
