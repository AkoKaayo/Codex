overview: |
  The Tarot is a dynamic, living language—each card is not an isolated symbol, but a note in a profound symphony. The true meaning of a reading arises from the interplay between cards, much like vowels and consonants coming together to form the soul of a word. Every card influences its neighbours, its order, and even its hidden numerical relationships. This guide is designed to remind you that every spread is a meditation on life’s continuous evolution, where each message is a gentle invitation to look inward and embrace both light and shadow.

single_card_reading: |
  A single card reading encapsulates the essence of the moment—a meditative mirror reflecting your inner state. Each card is a microcosm of your inner universe, a condensed symbol that holds the entirety of your personal cosmos within its imagery, keywords, and detailed descriptions. In this quiet space, allow the card’s symbolism to speak to you of your current challenges, potential, and deep truths. It is an invitation to pause, reflect, and connect with the universal energy present in every moment.

three_card_reading: |
  The three-card spread is like a poetic sentence composed of past, present, and future. Traditionally:
  
    A: The past – the lingering echoes and formative experiences.
    B: The present – the current state, the heart of the matter.
    C: The future – the emerging path or potential transformation.
  
  Begin by gently meditating on each card individually, drawing from its keywords, interpretations, and imagery. Then, allow the insights to merge into a cohesive narrative—a reflective story that weaves the lessons of the past with the wisdom of the present, gently guiding you toward what may emerge in the future. This spread is both practical and profoundly spiritual, offering a roadmap for your journey.

five_card_reading: |
  The five-card spread invites you to explore the issue on multiple levels, enriching the reading with depth and nuance. A commonly used structure is:
  
    A: What prevents you from being yourself – the inner obstacles or blockages.
    B: With what means can you free yourself – the hidden resources or methods for liberation.
    C: What action should you undertake – the concrete step or decision.
    D: Into what transformation you are being led – the nature of the evolving change.
    E: What is your ultimate purpose or destiny – the calling that awaits realisation.
  
  For each position, meditate on the card’s detailed meaning and symbolism. Then, integrate these layers into a gentle summary that captures how these elements interweave into your life’s unfolding story. The final narrative should resonate like a quiet revelation, offering both practical guidance and spiritual insight.

couples_and_relationships: |
  One of the most profound aspects of Tarot reading is its ability to reveal the subtle art of relationships. In every reading, note the natural pairings and complementary energies:
  
    • The High Priestess and The Pope remind us of the need for balanced spiritual guidance.
    • The Empress and The Emperor symbolise the harmonious union of creative fertility and structured order.
    • The Moon and The Sun, along with the Court Cards’ Queens and Kings, illustrate the interplay of opposites in nurturing our inner world.
  
  Consider how the order of cards deepens their message—for instance, a lower-numbered card preceding a higher one may suggest a foundational influence. Matching numerical pairs (like 1 with 11 or 2 with 12) reinforce and nuance the core message. Let these insights guide you to see relationships not as fixed entities but as a meditative dialogue between complementary forces.

conclusion: |
  A Tarot reading is a conversation with your soul—a gentle, ever-evolving dialogue between the known and the hidden. Interpretations are not absolute; they are reflections that encourage growth, healing, and self-discovery. Whether the message is light or shadowed, each reading is an opportunity to understand yourself more deeply and to embrace change as a constant, natural force.

  Trust in the wisdom of the cards as they mirror your journey. Embrace both the joys and the challenges, knowing that every insight—no matter how subtle—is a step toward your greater self.

  When generating a spread reading:
  - Begin with a brief, meditative interpretation for each card, using the detailed keywords, interpretations, and descriptions from its file.
  - Synthesize these insights into a reflective summary that narrates the unfolding story of your spread.
  - Acknowledge that every reading is fluid—balancing both positive and negative aspects—while ultimately inviting you to explore new perspectives.
  - Use language that is empathetic, empowering, and gentle, ensuring the reading serves as a guide for self-reflection and personal growth.
  
  For the single, three-, and five-card spreads, allow your inner voice to resonate through the reading. Each card is a sacred symbol—an invitation to pause, reflect, and act with both heart and mind.
