overview: |
  The Cups in the Minor Arcana represent the entire spectrum of emotional life, 
  from love’s earliest stirrings to its transcendent states. Rooted in intuition 
  and relational bonds, each card (Ace through Ten) narrates a stage in the 
  heart’s development. This suit is the “language of the heart,” emphasizing 
  empathy and the importance of letting feeling flow. When these emotional 
  waters stagnate, they lead to jealousy or bitterness; when they are freely 
  shared, they renew emotional life again and again.

  According to the numerology outlined in the PDF, Aces present limitless 
  potential, Twos accumulate feelings without realization, Threes erupt with 
  ideal love, Fours establish security, Fives challenge the heart with 
  fanatic devotion, Sixes create mirror-like unions, Sevens expand into 
  humanitarian love, Eights seek perfection, Nines prepare for the end 
  of one emotional cycle, and Tens hold universal love that awaits a 
  higher call.

suit: "Cups"

cards:
  - number: "Ace"
    name: "Ace of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Potential of all feelings"
      - "Capacity for immense love"
      - "Cathedral-like fullness"
      - "Infinite emotional source"
      - "Unemployed compassion"
    interpretations: |
      The Ace of Cups symbolizes love in its pure, unspent potential—a chalice brimming 
      with every possibility of the heart. It stands for budding devotion, romantic 
      yearning, or mystical longing. It illustrates that everything is possible, 
      from deep affection to spiritual grace. 

      If left unrealized, such abundance can sour into jealousy, bitterness, or an 
      insatiable emotional craving. The call is to pour this love into the world 
      rather than let it stagnate.

      Numerologically, the Ace points to an androgynous “Totality in potential.” 
      The PDF describes it as a chalice that is “still closed yet full,” reflecting 
      how emotional virginity can renew itself ceaselessly, drawing from a bottomless well.
    description: |
      The card depicts a grand Cup, often likened to a cathedral or a chalice. Its base 
      suggests a pyramid with three faces—creation, conservation, and destruction—which 
      underscores that love continually regenerates when shared. Above the “flesh-colored” 
      foundation, the structure expands into concentric circles that represent past and 
      future hopes (green) and the pure present (red). A red dome at the top signifies 
      total love imbued with consciousness. Three palm leaves beneath the Cup represent 
      intuition that has crossed suffering, merging into purified light. This Cup is 
      only valuable if it pours itself into the world.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ace of Cups indicates a fresh emotional or spiritual chapter: 
      new romance, creative inspiration founded in empathy, or a call to open your heart. 
      It invites you to let feelings flow freely instead of holding them in. 
      The heart’s renewal stands ready, contingent on your willingness to share it.
    monologue: |
      “I am the chalice of inexhaustible love, poised to overflow. 
      Drink of my waters, and discover within your heart 
      the capacity for boundless grace.”

  - number: "Two"
    name: "Two of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Accumulation of feelings"
      - "Amorous daydream"
      - "Oedipal echo"
      - "Preparation for love"
      - "Hesitation"
    interpretations: |
      The Two of Cups depicts tender feelings that have yet to be realized. 
      It references daydreams, the thirst for love born in someone who may 
      lack direct experience, or who projects an “ideal partner” shaped by 
      familial images. The Other has not yet appeared; the heart remains 
      confined to imagination. 

      Positively, it points to the dawn of real emotional engagement once 
      the person dares to step beyond fantasy. Negatively, it can indicate 
      immaturity, timidity, or inability to establish real relationships 
      due to clinging to childlike ideals of love.
    description: |
      Two Cups are balanced in a mirrored arrangement that suggests attraction 
      without consummation. Beneath them, references to phoenix symbolism point 
      to love’s universal force, capable of dying and being reborn. Fishlike 
      creatures feeding a central flower allude to narcissistic self-projection, 
      hinting that early love fantasies often reflect the self more than a 
      true encounter.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Two of Cups signals an early emotional stage: a 
      budding attraction, unspoken infatuation, or a longing for deep 
      connection. Moving from daydream to reality requires stepping 
      beyond family-bound illusions and risking genuine interaction.
    monologue: |
      “Within me, your heart stirs with potential love, shaped by older 
      patterns. Let reverie become motion, or remain forever suspended 
      in untried longing.”

  - number: "Three"
    name: "Three of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Initial burst of love"
      - "Romantic ideal"
      - "Joyous fanaticism"
      - "Youthful passion"
      - "Potential heartbreak"
    interpretations: |
      The Three of Cups represents the exuberant emergence of first love, 
      replete with adolescent excitement or the rediscovery of romance 
      at any age. Enthusiasm soars, and the heart blooms with new confidence. 
      However, this idealization can lead to deep wounds if it crumbles.

      Numerologically, Threes convey “creative explosion.” In Cups, this 
      explosion is emotional or romantic, signifying fervent union—adolescent 
      or otherwise. The same fervor risks heartbreak if reality fails 
      to align with the fantasy.
    description: |
      The card portrays three Cups set in a dynamic formation. The top cup 
      rests in a heartlike structure supported by two leaves, symbolizing 
      pure romantic intoxication. Beneath them, additional shapes protect 
      and reinforce this “ideal love,” which can quickly become disappointment 
      if illusions shatter.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Three of Cups heralds new emotional discovery, the 
      joyous rush of blossoming romance, or creative synergy. Let your heart 
      revel in the enchantment, but remember that abrupt disillusion is 
      possible if expectations outpace reality.
    monologue: |
      “I am the first bloom of passion, sweet and fearless. Celebrate my 
      rush of feeling, yet stay mindful should dreams outstrip what 
      life can sustain.”

  - number: "Four"
    name: "Four of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Emotional stability"
      - "Search for comfort"
      - "Risk of routine"
      - "Family basis"
      - "Security in love"
    interpretations: |
      The Four of Cups depicts love that has matured enough to provide 
      emotional security or a sense of family. It implies comfort, trust, 
      or a foundation where the heart can rest. However, this very stability 
      can lull the soul into monotony or dependence if no further 
      growth occurs.

      According to the numerology, Four is a square: stable and 
      supportive. In Cups, it resonates with longing for a “higher” 
      dimension of love, but only if one continues to deepen genuine 
      connection rather than relying on the relationship 
      as mere security.
    description: |
      The card shows four Cups in a sturdy arrangement, with the bottom 
      pair supporting the top pair, reflecting the shift from ideal love 
      (Three) to tangible grounding (Four). There is an upward aspiration, 
      but it can also indicate the heart “submitting” to a strong partner 
      out of fear or low self-worth if personal growth is neglected.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Four of Cups calls you to honor and enjoy your 
      emotional shelter—be it a partnership, family, or self-assured 
      sense of self-love. Balance comfort with a willingness to grow. 
      If the foundation remains static, love may congeal into habit.
    monologue: |
      “I cradle your heart in steady arms, a place of familiar solace. 
      Yet do not let my warmth lull you into sleep; the spirit thrives 
      on both safety and daring.”

  - number: "Five"
    name: "Five of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "New ideal"
      - "Emotional fanaticism"
      - "Faith or zeal"
      - "Possible illusions"
      - "Threshold of transformation"
    interpretations: |
      The Five of Cups centers on the emergence of an exalted emotional 
      vision. This may be a teacher, a religion, a moral ideal, or a 
      deep calling that transcends mundane life. The heart feels 
      uplifted—perhaps fanatically—yet illusions can lurk if 
      projection replaces genuine understanding.

      Numerologically, Five is temptation or a bridge to new worlds. 
      In Cups, it suggests fervor and the risk of heartbreak when 
      lofty ideals collide with human fragility. Enthusiasm is 
      powerful, but grounding is essential.
    description: |
      The card reveals a richly adorned central Cup that carries a 
      sense of elevation or “temple-like” structure. Surrounding 
      floral elements indicate the passionate fervor that draws the 
      heart upward. A small yellow heart rooted near the base 
      reminds us that even the highest spiritual longing 
      touches the earthly plane.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Five of Cups presents a beckoning toward 
      deeper emotional purpose or devotion, yet warns of 
      disillusion if the revered ideal proves all too mortal. 
      Use discernment when offering your heart to a cause, 
      teacher, or beloved.
    monologue: |
      “I open a bright portal for your heart, shining beyond 
      the mundane. Accept my invitation with clarity, or 
      risk heartbreak when the world reveals its limits.”

  - number: "Six"
    name: "Six of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Mirror-like union"
      - "Beauty in love"
      - "Self-acceptance"
      - "Emotional fulfillment"
      - "Risk of insularity"
    interpretations: |
      The Six of Cups signals a harmonious state of emotional completeness—two 
      mirrored trios forming a blessed union. This can indicate a bond that 
      fulfills intellect, heart, and instinct in a radiant synergy. While 
      it brings sweet contentment, it can also become self-absorbed if it 
      shuts out broader life.

      Numerologically, Six represents beauty. In Cups, that beauty 
      is an intimate reflection, exemplifying a “sister soul” or 
      profound self-love. If it excludes the outside world, it 
      mutates into narcissistic enclosure.
    description: |
      Two columns of Cups face each other around an axis, emphasizing a 
      mirrored arrangement. This design demonstrates a tranquil 
      equivalence or a “kindred spirit.” Love or self-acceptance 
      flourishes in a closed circuit unless shared beyond the pair.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Six of Cups invites you to enjoy a gentle 
      blossoming of love or the pleasure of reconnecting with an 
      old fondness. It can also reflect self-reconciliation. 
      Remember that authentic harmony grows stronger when it 
      includes the broader community.
    monologue: |
      “I reflect your heart in a gentle mirror. Bask in the 
      sweetness of this union, but do not lock the door against 
      the rest of existence.”

  - number: "Seven"
    name: "Seven of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Action in the world"
      - "Humanitarian love"
      - "Joyous expansion"
      - "Generosity"
      - "Potential altruism"
    interpretations: |
      The Seven of Cups marks the transition from private devotion to 
      outward-directed love. Emotions that once revolved around personal 
      or pairwise fulfillment now expand to embrace humanitarian impulses, 
      charity, or community-building. When guided by wisdom, this can 
      manifest as altruism or philanthropic deeds.

      Negatively, good intentions can scatter, leading to naive or 
      condescending attitudes. Remaining balanced ensures that giving 
      serves genuine needs rather than personal self-image.
    description: |
      The layout arranges four Cups around a core group of three, showing 
      how love that was once personal now radiates out. One Cup at the base 
      energizes and influences all the others, ensuring that 
      emotional fullness spreads into the world rather than stays locked 
      in a private sphere.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Seven of Cups encourages active compassion, 
      volunteering, or championing a worthy cause. The heart’s bounty 
      matures when shared. Stay grounded, since naive altruism can 
      breed disappointment or exploitation.
    monologue: |
      “I guide your affections beyond the walls of personal joy, 
      showing love’s true power in community. Offer your heart 
      with discernment, and see it flourish in the greater world.”

  - number: "Eight"
    name: "Eight of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Fullness of heart"
      - "Perfection of love"
      - "Grace and harmony"
      - "Universal compassion"
      - "Effortless acceptance"
    interpretations: |
      The Eight of Cups depicts the heart in its most abundant and 
      perfected form. Love embraces past, present, and future without 
      fear. There is no question of being loved or unloved; the entire 
      being flows with universal compassion. This resonates with the 
      idea of the “flaming heart,” fully at peace yet radiating outward.

      Negatively, it appears as the refusal to accept this universal 
      love. Perpetual dissatisfaction or a pretense of giving while 
      still grasping can taint the joy.
    description: |
      The arrangement shows eight Cups that fill each corner or axis, 
      suggesting a stable, overflowing emotional field. In the center, 
      the spark of divine love unites them all, portraying the “all love” 
      state described in the PDF. The heart no longer questions itself.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Eight of Cups signals a profound emotional harmony, 
      ready to pour itself into any needful place. Release petty questions 
      of reciprocation. This is charity, devotion, or acceptance at its 
      highest expression.
    monologue: |
      “I am the heart that overflows in every direction—past, present, 
      and future. Enter my embrace, and discover there is no corner 
      untouched by love.”

  - number: "Nine"
    name: "Nine of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Autumn of the heart"
      - "Mourning for renewal"
      - "End of a cycle"
      - "Sacrifice of old ties"
      - "Transition"
    interpretations: |
      At the Nine, the emotional cycle nears its completion. Some 
      attachments wilt, indicating the heart must let go of feelings 
      that once served but now constrain. This ending allows the 
      emergence of deeper or broader love, yet it often demands a 
      painful or bittersweet farewell.

      Numerologically, Nine stands for crisis before the next step. 
      In Cups, it is a gentle readiness to release old affections, 
      preparing for something new. If resisted, it can fester as 
      despair or clinging to what no longer nurtures.
    description: |
      The card shows certain Cups in an exalted arrangement, while 
      withered leaves appear, representing outgrown emotional states. 
      This shift is both wise and necessary. What you surrender 
      becomes the compost for future love.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Nine of Cups advises a willingness to 
      mourn what once nourished you but has become confining. 
      By making space, you create room for the next emotional 
      chapter, possibly leading to a more universal or 
      transformative love.
    monologue: |
      “I ask you to release the fading warmth of yesteryear. 
      Embrace this parting so that the heart may grow beyond 
      its previous boundaries.”

  - number: "Ten"
    name: "Ten of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Fulfillment of the heart"
      - "Universal love sealed"
      - "Awaiting higher purpose"
      - "Communion realized"
      - "Possibility of stagnation"
    interpretations: |
      The Ten of Cups displays emotional life in its culmination. 
      Nine Cups are open, and the tenth is sealed after receiving 
      all it can hold. This final Cup is like a saintly vessel 
      waiting for a divine commission—a sense that love has 
      reached wholeness and now longs to serve a greater calling.

      If neglected, this totality may congeal, leaving the heart 
      self-satisfied but no longer evolving. If welcomed, it 
      becomes the basis for higher service or transformation— 
      the next cycle is ready to begin.
    description: |
      The nine open Cups have five “sections” each, referring to the 
      five senses, while the top (tenth) Cup bears seven sections, 
      reflecting the seven nerve centers (or chakras). Love stops 
      requesting and transforms into potential for action. 
      It awaits a cause or mission beyond itself.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ten of Cups signifies the completion of 
      an emotional journey and a readiness to move beyond personal 
      gratification. This can indicate deep domestic happiness, 
      unconditional love, or spiritual devotion that now 
      seeks real-world application.
    monologue: |
      “I hold the entire heart’s longing, sealed at last in fullness. 
      If you linger only in contentment, you may stall. Let me 
      guide you toward a purpose that offers the world 
      what you have found.”
