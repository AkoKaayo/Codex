overview: |
  The Cups in the Minor Arcana represent the entire spectrum of emotional life, from love’s 
  earliest stirrings to its transcendent states. Rooted in feelings, intuition, and relational 
  bonds, each card (Ace through Ten) narrates a specific stage in the development of the heart. 
  Whether expressing pure potential or culminating in universal love, the suit of Cups reminds 
  us that the emotional realm—like water—must flow to stay healthy, or risk stagnation and sorrow.

suit: "Cups"

cards:
  - number: "Ace"
    name: "Ace of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Love in potential"
      - "Emotional abundance"
      - "Cathedral of the heart"
      - "Infinite possibilities"
      - "Overflowing chalice"
    interpretations: |
      The Ace of Cups symbolises love in its pure potential—a cathedral or chalice that 
      is still closed yet brimming with promise. It encompasses every shade of emotional 
      life, from spiritual devotion to romantic euphoria, and reminds us that love 
      ceaselessly renews itself like an everlasting well. 
      
      Negative aspects include unrequited or obsessive longing, a sense of emptiness 
      if one fails to pour this love into the world, or an insatiable emotional need 
      that can manifest as jealousy, bitterness, or smothering demands.
    description: |
      At the card’s base lies a fresh, flesh-coloured structure—virginal matter signifying 
      the newborn potential of the heart. Above it, a layered “temple” or “cup” ascends, 
      merging elements of spiritual intelligence (the sword-like tip) and receptive 
      feeling. Concentric circles—green for hope, red for passion—evoke past and future 
      times, emphasising that love spans every dimension.
      
      Three palm leaves at the bottom represent the dynamic, growing connection between 
      mind (blue) and matter (red), culminating in a halo of pure white light. This entire 
      structure is a chalice of cosmic love. Yet its gift must be shared—if this cup 
      never empties, its bounty goes stale.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ace of Cups heralds a fresh emotional or spiritual chapter, beckoning 
      you to open your heart. It may point to new romance, forgiveness, or creative inspiration 
      founded in empathy. Embrace its promise, and let feelings flow freely rather than 
      remain locked in yearning.
    monologue: |
      "I am the wellspring of inexhaustible love, poised to overflow into your world. 
      Come drink of my waters, and discover that your heart can hold the entire universe."

  - number: "Two"
    name: "Two of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Amorous daydream"
      - "Union or pairing"
      - "Preparation for love"
      - "Hesitation"
      - "Oedipal echo"
    interpretations: |
      The Two of Cups signifies a receptive emotional state in which affection and longing 
      accumulate, though not yet realised. It is the realm of amorous fantasy: the desire 
      for the Other is shaped by idealised images—potentially reflecting family patterns 
      or childhood dreams. 
      
      Positively, it sets the stage for genuine connection once the heart dares to move 
      beyond fantasy. Negatively, one may remain confined to daydreams or cling to a childlike 
      vision of love that avoids mature engagement.
    description: |
      Often illustrated with a central or mirrored arrangement of cups, the card emphasises 
      duality: two vessels poised for union. Hidden angels or a phoenix in some depictions 
      remind us that these daydreams can be sublimated into genuine relationships—or 
      descend into unfulfilled illusions if no real step is taken.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Two of Cups indicates that an emotional attraction or partnership 
      is forming but not fully tangible. Recognise the difference between reverie and 
      reality, and muster the courage to let love step into the world.
    monologue: |
      "Within me, your heart twinkles with potential but stands untested. Let longing 
      become motion, and imagination turn to genuine exchange; only then can love 
      truly flourish."

  - number: "Three"
    name: "Three of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Initial burst of love"
      - "Romantic ideal"
      - "Joyous fanaticism"
      - "Youthful passion"
      - "Uncertain consequences"
    interpretations: |
      The Three of Cups symbolises the vibrant explosion of first love, charged with 
      adolescent energy or renewed passion at any age. Enthusiasm soars—yet one risks 
      heartbreak if the dream shatters. This card speaks of springlike blossoming 
      and the exhilarating chaos of new romance.
    description: |
      Typically, three cups—arranged in a dynamic structure—express the heart’s 
      immediate, potent rush. There may be a central cup, brimming with symbolic 
      flowers, representing the unbridled confidence of youthful ardour. 
      
      The raw force of this outbreak can be creative or destructive, depending on 
      how it’s guided. 
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Three of Cups encourages you to relish the excitement of 
      fresh emotional discovery. It warns, however, against naivety: remain open 
      to love’s blossoming but be prepared should it not follow your every 
      adolescent whim.
    monologue: |
      "I am the first bloom of passion, green and strong, thrilling as spring 
      after a long winter. Dare to rejoice, but know that once the petals 
      open, they may face sun—or storm."

  - number: "Four"
    name: "Four of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Emotional stability"
      - "Security in love"
      - "Family basis"
      - "Risk of routine"
      - "Search for comfort"
    interpretations: |
      The Four of Cups depicts a securely rooted emotional situation: a love or 
      family dynamic that, while dependable, risks growing stale. Such stability 
      can foster deep trust—yet if turned into mere habit or material considerations, 
      the heart’s vitality withers.
    description: |
      Common art for the Four of Cups may show two cups at the base and two at the top, 
      forming a sturdy pillar. The sense is of love aspiring upward yet anchored 
      in mutual reliance. Its horizontal leaves or structural elements evoke a 
      family “table” or platform that supports the relationship.
    reading: |
      In a spread, this card calls you to appreciate your emotional foundation while 
      remaining attentive to personal growth. Whether in marriage, friendship, or 
      self-love, avoid letting ease stagnate into apathy. Re-examine the heart’s 
      deeper call.
    monologue: |
      "Steady as a well-built home, I shelter your heart from tempests. But do not 
      bury passion for comfort’s sake—love’s hearth must stay alive with sparks."

  - number: "Five"
    name: "Five of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "New ideal"
      - "Emotional fanaticism"
      - "Enthusiasm or deception"
      - "Threshold of transformation"
      - "Passage between worlds"
    interpretations: |
      The Five of Cups introduces a new emotional ideal—possibly one of spiritual 
      devotion, romantic extremism, or deep moral longing. Its aura of temptation 
      can heighten love into a fervent quest, but illusions may abound. The negative 
      side includes gullibility, unrequited worship, or heartbreak upon realising 
      the Other is merely human.
    description: |
      Often showing a central cup lifted by an ornate structure, the card reveals 
      how the emotional realm aspires to contact a higher dimension. While noble, 
      such longing can teeter between saintly transcendence and desperate hero-worship.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Five of Cups indicates a beckoning for deeper emotional 
      purpose. You may feel drawn to an ideal that transcends the everyday. Ensure 
      that you keep your bearings, or else illusions and disappointment may unfold.
    monologue: |
      "I open a door beyond your usual horizon—an ideal so bright it dazzles. 
      Let devotion lift you, but guard against illusions; in the effort to reach 
      the infinite, your heart must still walk upon the earth."

  - number: "Six"
    name: "Six of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Beauty in love"
      - "Mirror-like union"
      - "Self-acceptance"
      - "Emotional fulfilment"
      - "Potential narcissism"
    interpretations: |
      The Six of Cups suggests the joyous state of emotional harmony—like soulmates 
      or mirrored halves discovering delight in one another. Whether it is self-love 
      purified or a meeting with a kindred spirit, the heart experiences beauty 
      and fullness. 
      
      Negatively, this card can point to a self-absorbed couple or emotional egoism 
      that excludes the world.
    description: |
      Artwork often features symmetrical cups or twin arrangements, signifying 
      reflection, harmony, or sweet union. This balanced formation can speak of 
      emotional complacency if not shared beyond the pair or individual.
    reading: |
      In a spread, the Six of Cups invites you to enjoy the gentle blossoming of 
      love or a warm friendship. It can indicate a time of nostalgic sweetness 
      or reconnection with a past joy. Beware, however, of shutting out reality 
      in a closed love circuit.
    monologue: |
      "Within my waters, you see your own reflection, radiant and true. Such 
      harmony nourishes the soul, yet remember that love shared beyond the self 
      magnifies its light."

  - number: "Seven"
    name: "Seven of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Action in the world"
      - "Humanitarian love"
      - "Joyous expansion"
      - "Generosity"
      - "Potential altruism"
    interpretations: |
      The Seven of Cups depicts a love that moves beyond personal confines to 
      touch the larger community. It carries the impetus to serve, to give 
      without demanding recognition. However, philanthropic illusions or 
      meddling paternalism can also arise when boundaries remain unclear.
    description: |
      Often there is an axis of cups leading from the grounded personal realm 
      to the cosmic. Leaves or tendrils reach outward, suggesting emotional 
      growth directed at humanity or nature itself.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Seven of Cups urges you to employ your emotional gifts 
      in altruistic pursuits or creative empathy. Ask not only what love can do 
      for you, but how it may heal others. Remain watchful of pride or saviour 
      fantasies.
    monologue: |
      "My heart brims with desire to give. Let me flow into the world, 
      washing away sorrow and bridging divides. Yet keep your feet on 
      the ground, so that mercy does not wander into vanity."

  - number: "Eight"
    name: "Eight of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Emotional perfection"
      - "Fullness"
      - "Cosmic harmony"
      - "Grace"
      - "All-encompassing love"
    interpretations: |
      The Eight of Cups heralds the heart’s attainment of near-complete perfection: 
      it is the emotive parallel to emptiness in Swords. Here, every corner of 
      feeling is saturated with kindness, empathy, and acceptance. Despite this 
      exaltation, one must remain humble, for perfection can freeze if not 
      applied in daily living.
    description: |
      Illustrations often show a symmetrical or multi-layered arrangement of cups, 
      some forming dynamic shapes signifying total love. The negative side can be 
      the fear of “coming down” from such heights or the inability to hold 
      practicality with spiritual bliss.
    reading: |
      In a spread, the Eight of Cups indicates that your emotional life has 
      reached a strong, beautiful equilibrium. Allow its spiritual power 
      to act upon your real circumstances. Elevation is meant to be shared, 
      not hoarded.
    monologue: |
      "I am the heart at rest in universal love. Open yourself to me, 
      and discover a capacity to forgive, to bless, to cherish unreservedly. 
      Yet do not dwell solely in the heavens; your kindness must grace the earth."

  - number: "Nine"
    name: "Nine of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Crisis of the heart"
      - "Letting go"
      - "Preparing for new dimension"
      - "Emotional autumn"
      - "Necessary mourning"
    interpretations: |
      The Nine of Cups depicts a stage where prior emotional fulfilment must 
      be surrendered to permit a new horizon of love. Leaves appear to wilt, 
      signifying a wise acceptance that certain attachments must be released. 
      This can be bittersweet but sets the stage for rebirth.
    description: |
      Imagery frequently shows a top row of cups still brimming and bottom cups 
      drooping or withering. The mood is autumnal: a reminder that the cycle 
      of love, like the seasons, requires letting go of old petals so fresh 
      blossoms can form.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Nine of Cups suggests a crisis or turning point in 
      emotional life. Though sadness may accompany the farewell, it paves 
      the way for deeper love or a fresh emotional identity.
    monologue: |
      "I am the hush before rebirth, the moment of farewell to a love 
      that no longer grows. Grieve if you must, for tears water 
      the seeds of tomorrow’s blossoming."

  - number: "Ten"
    name: "Ten of Cups"
    keywords:
      - "Culmination"
      - "Universal love"
      - "Completion of a cycle"
      - "Overflowing heart"
      - "Awaiting new service"
    interpretations: |
      The Ten of Cups marks the completion of the cups journey: nine open 
      cups plus a tenth that is sealed, signifying love that no longer 
      needs anything for itself. It stands ready to serve the world or 
      evolve into a brand-new cycle. Yet if one clings to this “final” 
      contentment, stagnation may result.
    description: |
      Typically, the arrangement shows an uppermost cup sealed off in a 
      state of perfect fullness—love’s pinnacle. The momentum is paused, 
      awaiting an impetus to apply this emotional wealth to another path 
      (like the Ace of Pentacles, or a spiritual calling).
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ten of Cups tells you that you have tasted 
      the maximum sweetness of a completed cycle. The heart stands 
      fulfilled, but life’s flow calls you onward. Use your love 
      to bless, guide, or embark on a new dream.
    monologue: |
      "I have reached the summit of the heart’s delight, and yet 
      I yearn to pour myself forth anew. Let me not be hoarded 
      in a golden chalice; your love is completed only when 
      it serves a greater awakening."
