# minor_arcana_wands.yml

overview: |
  The Wands in the Minor Arcana symbolize sexual and creative energy—vitality that 
  can propel personal expression, artistry, or physical desire. Each card (Ace 
  through Ten) illustrates a stage in the Wand’s journey: from raw, untamed 
  potential to a final transformation that transcends mere passion. While creativity 
  and passion can enrich life with ardor and magic, they carry risks if misdirected. 
  The Wands remind us that we do not create desire ex nihilo—we channel and shape 
  it consciously.

  Numerologically, Aces hold the primordial spark, Twos store it in a “virgin” 
  state, Threes burst forth, Fours anchor it, Fives invite deeper or revolutionary 
  impulses, Sixes find exquisite pleasure, Sevens project power that can be 
  altruistic or tyrannical, Eights refine action to its essence, Nines face 
  absolute commitment, and Tens break open to a new calling beyond the 
  immediate creative or sexual domain.

suit: "Wands"

cards:
  - number: "Ace"
    name: "Ace of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Raw creative force"
      - "Potential for vitality"
      - "Sexual potency"
      - "Courage to act"
      - "Risk of aggression"
    interpretations: |
      The Ace of Wands indicates a vast reservoir of vital, creative energy 
      waiting to be channeled. It can herald a dynamic new project or the 
      awakening of sexual desire. This power must be shaped consciously 
      or it may erupt destructively or be squandered.

      Numerologically, the Ace carries the primal spark that everything 
      in the Wands suit will develop. If approached with intelligence, 
      it serves as the impetus to conquer obstacles; if allowed to run 
      wild, it becomes violence or blocked desire.
    description: |
      The card shows a single Wand brimming with energy. The top is 
      thicker, referencing the phallic symbol, yet also morphs into 
      a subtly feminine form. Branches or sprigs mark the potential 
      for multiple directions. Each point of growth offers a chance 
      to sublimate the raw “green” energy into a higher purpose.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ace of Wands calls you to seize a surge of 
      creative or erotic power. Embark on your endeavor with boldness, 
      or channel newly awakened desire with responsibility. Neglect 
      of this spark leads to aggression, frustration, or a 
      “fizzled start.”
    monologue: |
      “I am the untamed spark of life, brimming with creative 
      and sexual charge. Grasp me with intention, and watch 
      your passion blaze into action.”

  - number: "Two"
    name: "Two of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Repressed energy"
      - "Virgin state"
      - "Potential in gestation"
      - "First glimmer of desire"
      - "Doubt in capacity"
    interpretations: |
      The Two of Wands represents a phase of accumulated force 
      that has not yet found outward expression. It can describe 
      intense but latent sexuality, or a creative idea lingering 
      before its actualization. This state is “virgin,” 
      waiting for decisive movement.

      Numerologically, Two is receptive accumulation. The user 
      contemplates or incubates a plan or desire, uncertain 
      when to act. The risk lies in indefinite postponement 
      or self-doubt.
    description: |
      Two slender Wands connect at a carefully wrought base that 
      holds repressed vigor. The subtle bulb or shape at the 
      crossing reveals a readiness to sprout. Desire remains 
      pure but untried, reminiscent of puberty before 
      the first experience.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Two of Wands reflects a crucial moment 
      of preparation. Energy runs high, though concealed. 
      Hesitation might stem from fear or overthinking. 
      Recognize the stored power and decide how to release it.
    monologue: |
      “I am unspent vigor, coiled and patient, awaiting your permission 
      to unfold. Let me out, or risk storing me forever in 
      silent indecision.”

  - number: "Three"
    name: "Three of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Burst of creative energy"
      - "Puberty of desire"
      - "Chaotic expansion"
      - "Initial success"
      - "Risk of scatter"
    interpretations: |
      The Three of Wands signifies a powerful eruption of energy. 
      This is akin to adolescence, when sexuality or creativity 
      awakens in a rush. It can generate breakthroughs but also 
      cause scattered efforts if not directed carefully.

      Numerologically, the Three is a “creative explosion.” 
      In Wands, it references both the unstoppable fervor 
      of new desire and the potential for overreach 
      when illusions overshadow practical constraints.
    description: |
      Three Wands meet at a vivid center, from which branches or 
      leaves shoot outward. This depiction confirms a robust 
      surge that thrusts one into action, sometimes with 
      little plan besides excitement.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Three of Wands proclaims a bold leap 
      forward. Seize the momentum but remain aware of 
      the need for some grounding. Without structure, 
      early triumphs can falter as quickly as they flare.
    monologue: |
      “I roar into being with the thrill of a first discovery, 
      brash and alive. Celebrate me, but know that without 
      direction, I may burn out before the journey 
      truly begins.”

  - number: "Four"
    name: "Four of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Established power"
      - "Stable creativity"
      - "Routine risk"
      - "Comfortable success"
      - "Solid partnership"
    interpretations: |
      The Four of Wands depicts desire that has found a reliable 
      form—whether in a creative project sustaining regular output 
      or a sexual relationship that offers security. This fosters 
      a sense of groundedness and repeated achievement.

      However, numerological Four warns that routine can kill 
      spontaneity. If the heart no longer grows, the solidity 
      becomes a prison. Repetition dulls the original spark.
    description: |
      Four Wands lock into a balanced pattern, producing 
      a “house” for the creative or sexual impulse. 
      Leaves or flowers confirm that success is now 
      consistent. Yet the structure can harden, 
      requiring the spirit to stay open to the next challenge.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Four of Wands encourages the 
      celebration of success and comfort. Appreciate 
      stability but stay alert to creeping boredom 
      or complacency. Security should not override 
      evolution.
    monologue: |
      “I stand as the fortress of your earned success, 
      the shape that protects your fire. But if 
      you do not venture beyond my walls, 
      you may forget why you began.”

  - number: "Five"
    name: "Five of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "New temptation"
      - "Yearning for deeper change"
      - "Bridge between known and unknown"
      - "Evolving passion"
      - "Potential conflict"
    interpretations: |
      The Five of Wands reveals a desire to break past 
      comfort. This might take the form of new sexual 
      frontiers, radical creativity, or spiritual 
      reorientation. The existing structure 
      (Four) is no longer enough.

      Numerologically, Five signals a temptation or 
      call to surpass old boundaries. Properly pursued, 
      it revitalizes and expands the self; 
      mishandled, it lapses into rebellion 
      without substance.
    description: |
      Five Wands form a crossing or a gap, indicating 
      the disruption of stable patterns. Leaves 
      or buds appear, showing that the impetus 
      can become a true transformation if faced 
      with sincerity rather than random revolt.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Five of Wands urges you 
      to follow your renewed cravings or creative 
      stirrings with caution and clarity. 
      Embrace the chance to evolve, but 
      avoid illusions or quick-fix excitements.
    monologue: |
      “I open a door to a realm beyond your familiar ground. 
      Let my call inspire a fresh quest, but choose well. 
      Shall you embrace new heights or dance with illusions?”

  - number: "Six"
    name: "Six of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Pleasure and ecstasy"
      - "Joy of creation"
      - "Sexual gratification"
      - "Potential narcissism"
      - "Fulfillment in expression"
    interpretations: |
      The Six of Wands reaches a pivotal expression 
      of pleasure, whether artistic or sexual. 
      Satisfaction runs high, offering 
      confidence and delight. It can be 
      the moment an artist discovers 
      a unique style or lovers find 
      deep harmony.

      Numerological Six refers to “beauty.” Here, 
      that beauty takes the form of fully 
      embraced desire. The danger is 
      narcissism—falling in love with 
      one’s own success at the expense 
      of further growth.
    description: |
      Six Wands converge in a pattern that radiates 
      exultation or synergy. It portrays a honeymoon 
      phase in both artistry and intimacy, 
      with all leaves or flowers fully open 
      to represent the blossoming joy of 
      acceptance and adoration.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Six of Wands signifies 
      a time of triumphant gratification. 
      Relish this wave of self-assurance 
      and shared delight, yet ensure 
      it remains inclusive and doesn’t 
      degenerate into a closed bubble 
      of self-absorption.
    monologue: |
      “I blaze with the delicious warmth of your creative 
      or erotic power, turning life into a festival. 
      May this feast sustain you, so long as you remember 
      to feed the world as well.”

  - number: "Seven"
    name: "Seven of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Expansive action"
      - "Blossoming power"
      - "Altruistic drive"
      - "Potential tyranny"
      - "Triumph of sexual/creative force"
    interpretations: |
      The Seven of Wands embodies unstoppable energy. 
      It can manifest as passionate leadership, healing, 
      or large-scale creative success. This card 
      references altruistic “insemination” of the world: 
      channeling your power outward so others can benefit.

      If misapplied, the same force becomes exploitative 
      or dictatorial. Numerologically, Seven 
      is action in the world; the impetus behind it 
      determines whether it blesses or crushes.
    description: |
      Seven Wands intersect at a central, intense 
      node of power, flaring outward. 
      Leaves or petals flourish with no sign 
      of restraint. This unstoppable surge 
      can build or destroy. 
      Its essence is impersonal cosmic fire, 
      directed by your heart’s intent.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Seven of Wands challenges 
      you to harness great passion responsibly. 
      Aim to uplift instead of dominating. 
      Your heightened energy must remain grounded 
      in respect for others to avoid destructive extremes.
    monologue: |
      “I offer an inexhaustible blaze that can light 
      the world or reduce it to ashes. 
      Choose now—will you erect a temple of hope 
      or a fortress of cruelty?”

  - number: "Eight"
    name: "Eight of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Perfect concentration"
      - "Refined creativity"
      - "Sublimation of desire"
      - "Effortless mastery"
      - "Risk of inertia"
    interpretations: |
      The Eight of Wands condenses the suit’s passion 
      into a single, focused point. Extraneous motions 
      vanish, culminating in swift, sure action. 
      This is the martial artist’s mastery or an 
      artist’s pure stroke. It represents 
      sublimation where raw desire transforms 
      into a perfect, minimal act.

      Negatively, chasing absolute perfection 
      can paralyze motion. A fixation on flawlessness 
      leads to inaction, ironically strangling 
      the energy it seeks to refine.
    description: |
      The Wands converge into a streamlined formation, 
      leaves pruned to essential forms. This reveals 
      how creativity or sexuality, harnessed with 
      discipline, becomes effortless. The suit’s 
      free-flaring growth is replaced by 
      targeted precision.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Eight of Wands signals 
      an optimal moment to execute tasks with 
      minimal waste. Let the pure impetus flow, 
      ignoring trivialities. Beware letting 
      perfectionism freeze your impetus. 
      Properly embraced, this is 
      unstoppable grace.
    monologue: |
      “I show you the power of one well-aimed arrow, 
      the unstoppable beauty of undistracted skill. 
      Enter my realm, but do not linger until 
      you can no longer move.”

  - number: "Nine"
    name: "Nine of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Life-or-death choice"
      - "Bare resolve"
      - "Ego’s final test"
      - "Make no concessions"
      - "Potential fear of totality"
    interpretations: |
      The Nine of Wands stands at a stark juncture. 
      All foliage is gone; illusions are stripped. 
      The creative or sexual force condenses 
      into uncompromising essence. 
      The motto becomes “win or die,” 
      although not literally—rather, 
      it is the fearless stance 
      of a warrior or artist 
      who leaves no room for half-measures.

      Numerologically, Nine signals a crisis 
      preceding transformation. 
      In Wands, it demands total authenticity. 
      Fear of losing the old identity 
      might sabotage the crossing.
    description: |
      The bare Wands form a stark axis, 
      confronting illusions or halfhearted 
      attempts. The domain of desire or creativity 
      no longer accommodates superficial pursuits. 
      One must either transform or remain behind.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Nine of Wands insists 
      on unwavering commitment. 
      Let go of safe illusions or 
      compromised efforts. 
      You stand at the threshold of 
      a deeper reality—act wholeheartedly 
      or relinquish the path.
    monologue: |
      “I bring you to the razor’s edge where indecision must end. 
      Act with total sincerity or step back into half-living. 
      The choice, stark and unadorned, is yours.”

  - number: "Ten"
    name: "Ten of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Completion of the cycle"
      - "Energy no longer contained"
      - "Transmutation of power"
      - "Passing into spirit"
      - "Potential disconnection"
    interpretations: |
      The Ten of Wands closes the suit’s fiery journey. 
      The Wand splits, creating an opening or “white axis” 
      for a new dimension. Passion or creativity must 
      move into another realm—spirituality, teaching, 
      healing, or intellectual pursuit.

      Numerologically, Ten ends one cycle 
      and hints at the next. If obstructed, 
      this card warns of burnout, bitterness, 
      or feeling uprooted. Properly embraced, 
      it channels the mature force of Wands 
      into a higher calling.
    description: |
      The central Wand divides, making space for 
      a new principle. Leaves or flowers reconfigure, 
      suggesting an angelic or transpersonal shape. 
      After so much fiery expansion, the energy 
      transcends the sexual/creative domain, 
      primed to surface anew as, for example, 
      the Ace of Swords.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ten of Wands proclaims the 
      end of a passionate era. Your once-vital impetus 
      seeks a new form. If you cling to old definitions, 
      you risk frustration. Embrace the transition 
      to discover a different path for your 
      now-mature energy.
    monologue: |
      “I mark the final moment in your fiery dance—beyond me 
      lies a new realm. Release what was, and discover how 
      your power is meant to evolve in the cycles ahead.”
