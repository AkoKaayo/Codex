overview: |
  The Wands in the Minor Arcana symbolise creative and sexual energy—vitality that 
  can propel personal expression, artistry, or physical desire. Each card from Ace 
  to Ten illustrates a stage in the Wand's journey: from raw, untamed potential to 
  concentrated mastery. While creativity and passion can enrich life with ardour 
  and magic, they also carry the risk of volatility when misdirected. The Wands 
  remind us that we do not manufacture desire—we channel or sublimate it, deciding 
  its direction.

suit: "Wands"

cards:
  - number: "Ace"
    name: "Ace of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Vital energy"
      - "Creative potential"
      - "Sexual force"
      - "Raw spark"
      - "Impetus"
    interpretations: |
      The Ace of Wands represents a large amount of vital energy in a state of 
      pure potential. This surging force underpins creative, sexual, and 
      inspirational drives. It can herald a breakthrough in artistic vision 
      or the ignition of a passionate encounter. 
      
      Negatively, the card may indicate a creative block or the misuse of 
      force—aggression, violence, or sexual abuse. It also warns of 
      hasty enthusiasm that fizzles out if not guided with care and 
      intelligence.
    description: |
      Traditionally depicted as a solitary wand radiating sparks of energy, 
      the Ace of Wands suggests unstoppable creative power. The wand often 
      grows thicker at the top, revealing its phallic connotation—yet 
      culminating in a shape reminiscent of the feminine, symbolising 
      the union of opposites. The presence of branching or leaves indicates 
      that the individual can choose how to direct or prune this energy, 
      allowing it to flourish in multiple forms. 
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ace of Wands invites you to seize the moment and let 
      your latent passion take form. Whether in an artistic project or a 
      romantic pursuit, harness your desire consciously—lest it erupt 
      destructively or evaporate prematurely.
    monologue: |
      "I am the raw pulse of creation, the spark that rouses your sleeping 
      passions. Grasp me boldly—yet shape my fire with intent, for I burn 
      brightest when fused with purpose."

  - number: "Two"
    name: "Two of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Accumulated desire"
      - "Repressed energy"
      - "Preparation"
      - "Virgin state"
      - "Puberty of creativity"
    interpretations: |
      The Two of Wands signifies a phase of gathering or storing desire, 
      sexuality, or creative impetus. This energy remains passive, 
      unexpressed—akin to puberty before the first true experience. 
      Positively, it readies the soul for decisive action. Negatively, 
      it could point to blocked energy, shyness, or doubt about one’s 
      creative or sexual capacity.
    description: |
      Often shown with two wands crossing or joined by a delicate bulb 
      or root, the imagery implies internal tension. A central bulb may 
      symbolise nascent desires incubating, waiting to shoot forth. 
      The slender wands emphasise that such energy, though quiescent, 
      is potent and can burst out once the right moment arrives.
    reading: |
      In a reading, this card suggests an important interval of quiet 
      gestation. Embrace it as a time to build confidence. Stay alert 
      for chances to channel your stored energy constructively rather 
      than repress it into frustration.
    monologue: |
      "In me, your creative might lies dormant, gathering warmth like 
      a seed in winter. Soon enough, you’ll choose: let the sap flow 
      or keep it locked in silent potential."

  - number: "Three"
    name: "Three of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Burst of energy"
      - "Adolescent desire"
      - "Explosive creation"
      - "First sexual experience"
      - "Fanaticism or reawakening"
    interpretations: |
      The Three of Wands symbolises a swift, impulsive eruption of energy. 
      This might correspond to puberty’s wild emergence or the first 
      decisive step in a creative effort. It contains both the exuberance 
      of new possibility and the threat of indiscriminate action. 
      
      At its best, the card fosters fertility in art or passion. At its 
      worst, it spawns chaos or ill-conceived endeavours.
    description: |
      Typically, three wands intersect at a vivid focal point, with 
      branches or leaves surging outward. The black dots or tips often 
      indicate raw, impersonal energy—fanatical or fiercely budding. 
      Though the swirl of possibility is exhilarating, it lacks the 
      guidance of experience.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Three of Wands announces the unstoppable onset 
      of action—like a newly awakened sexual appetite or an eager 
      creative start. Channel the fervour mindfully, or risk quick 
      disillusionment if it fails to find form.
    monologue: |
      "Hear my springtime cry—vibrant, bold, and unstoppable. The world 
      will yield to my blossoming force, but I beg you: steer me with 
      wisdom so that I may truly thrive."

  - number: "Four"
    name: "Four of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Stability"
      - "Regular sexuality"
      - "Repetition"
      - "Creative routine"
      - "Material security"
    interpretations: |
      The Four of Wands refers to an established anchor for creative or 
      sexual energy. In personal relationships, it hints at comfortable 
      intimacy or a routine erotic life. In artistry, it suggests 
      regularly producing the same style or repeated success. 
      
      While stability fosters security and reliability, it can also 
      dull the freshness vital to ongoing inspiration.
    description: |
      Often depicted as four wands forming a structured shape, this card 
      evokes a protective enclosure or framework. Leaves or flowers may 
      echo the cyclical nature of daily practice—a saint who always 
      repeats the same miracles, or an artist producing the same works. 
      Vital energy is harnessed in a predictable form.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Four of Wands encourages you to consolidate 
      success or find reliability in your creative or sexual expression. 
      Yet it cautions that comfort can slide into stagnation if no 
      evolution follows.
    monologue: |
      "I am the builder of your safe haven, the daily weaving of desire 
      or talent that steadies your life. But do not let me become a cage— 
      routine is sweet yet must open to new wonders."

  - number: "Five"
    name: "Five of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "New desire"
      - "Bridge to another dimension"
      - "Temptation"
      - "Revolutionary spirit"
      - "Mystical or sexual impulse"
    interpretations: |
      The Five of Wands represents the emergence of a new point of view 
      or yearning that shakes existing stability. This card fosters an 
      energetic leap—perhaps spiritual or sexual—that can either refine 
      the old or overthrow it. The impetus may be mystical, erotic, 
      or a fresh impetus for creativity. 
      
      Negatively, illusions or manipulative lures (empty promises or 
      swindlers) can ambush the eager. It warns: do not trust 
      “revolutionary” talk blindly; real transformation demands sincerity.
    description: |
      Imagery often shows five wands forming a gap or bridging shape, 
      symbolising the crossing between old security (the Four) and a 
      newly opened horizon. Floral buds may appear, heralding a 
      transforming or radical shift. 
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Five of Wands invites you to follow your 
      emergent cravings or epiphanies with discernment. Harness your 
      rebellious or creative stirrings for genuine growth, rather than 
      fleeing the known on a whim or false ideal.
    monologue: |
      "I am the flame that tempts you from your cosy fire— 
      risk a step beyond the usual, and discover worlds 
      unnamed. Yet do not be fooled by hollow calls; real 
      change births from the union of passion and truth."

  - number: "Six"
    name: "Six of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Pleasure"
      - "Beauty"
      - "Union"
      - "Narcissism risk"
      - "Creative delight"
    interpretations: |
      The Six of Wands sings of total sexual or creative pleasure— 
      a joyous union with self or another. Creation flourishes as 
      a fulfilling dance, and life brims with inspiring possibility. 
      Yet self-absorption can mar this card, turning self-celebration 
      into conceit, or sexual desire into a closed loop that forgets 
      the broader world.
    description: |
      Often illustrated with wands crossing in vibrant synergy, 
      leaves or petals may appear fully opened, representing 
      a pleasurable bloom. This card echoes a “honeymoon” phase 
      in both artistry and intimacy.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Six of Wands reveals a peak of rapturous 
      gratification—creative synergy or erotic fulfilment that 
      tastes sweet indeed. Do not withdraw from reality in 
      self-satisfied indulgence, but share your delight and 
      stay open to continued evolution.
    monologue: |
      "I bask in my own radiant success—drunk on creation’s 
      sweetness. Join me in bliss, but remember: true ecstasy 
      glows brighter when mirrored in the larger tapestry of life."

  - number: "Seven"
    name: "Seven of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Total sexual/creative action"
      - "Altruistic energy"
      - "Immense force"
      - "Dictatorship if misused"
      - "Union of matter and spirit"
    interpretations: |
      The Seven of Wands denotes an apex of outward action—a 
      forceful, charismatic, and unstoppable energy in the 
      sexual or creative domain. Done well, it channels 
      passion into heroic or humanitarian ends. Done poorly, 
      it can dominate, coerce, or subjugate. 
      
      Positively, the card suggests unstoppable creative 
      impetus or philanthropy. Negatively, tyranny or 
      manipulative sexual proselytising emerges if 
      humility is abandoned.
    description: |
      Imagery typically reveals seven wands, the central 
      axis blazing with vitality while leaves or flowers 
      spiral outward. This unstoppable impetus merges 
      physical desire with deeper spiritual or moral 
      convictions, for good or ill.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Seven of Wands offers unstoppable 
      impetus—creative, sexual, or philanthropic. Guide 
      your dynamic fervour ethically, or risk falling 
      into a controlling stance, losing sight of 
      empathy in your personal campaign.
    monologue: |
      "I thunder across your horizon, bristling with 
      might and purpose. Focus my roar on uplifting 
      hearts, lest I trample them."

  - number: "Eight"
    name: "Eight of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Concentration"
      - "Sublimation"
      - "Perfection"
      - "Creative magic"
      - "Routine or paralysis"
    interpretations: |
      The Eight of Wands embodies the attainment of near-perfect 
      concentration—the blossoming of sexual or creative energy 
      into a pure, unadorned axis. Sublimation refines desire 
      into a higher calling or artistry. Conversely, if fear 
      hampers it, the flow stalls, leading to paralysis or 
      sterility.
    description: |
      Commonly, the card lacks extensive foliage, instead 
      focusing on the wands’ intersection of lines or 
      an uncluttered central pattern. This signals the 
      transformation of scattered impulses into a single, 
      potent direction. The slightest distraction can 
      shatter this elevated focus.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Eight of Wands warns that you 
      stand on the brink of creative or erotic mastery. 
      Properly harnessed, your energy becomes unstoppable; 
      neglected, it withers into frustration or numbness.
    monologue: |
      "I cast aside the decorative flourish—what remains 
      is essence sharpened to a spear. Let me channel 
      your energy into flawless precision; do not 
      shy away from the purity of purpose."

  - number: "Nine"
    name: "Nine of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Win or die"
      - "Stripped of embellishment"
      - "Fear of death"
      - "Creative crisis"
      - "Implacable choice"
    interpretations: |
      The Nine of Wands stands at a crossroads: 
      all illusions or side shoots vanish. One 
      must choose to persist, giving everything 
      to the craft or passion, or yield to fear. 
      This moment may evoke the existential 
      “fight or surrender” dynamic. 
      
      Positively, it fosters unwavering determination; 
      negatively, it can manifest as panic or 
      self-sabotage.
    description: |
      Typically shown with bare wands, stripped 
      of leaves or ornaments, the card emphasises 
      minimalism and severity. Red and blue 
      intersections reveal the interplay between 
      impetus and receptivity, culminating in 
      an urgent confrontation with one’s limits.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Nine of Wands demands 
      raw courage. Will you press on with your 
      entire being, or retreat in fear? A 
      fundamental test looms in sexuality or 
      creativity— one that can lead to triumph 
      or tragic defeat.
    monologue: |
      "My stage is harshly lit—no props, no 
      curtains, only the bare ring of conflict. 
      Let your fervour be your shield. Either 
      fight for your vision, or lose it forever."

  - number: "Ten"
    name: "Ten of Wands"
    keywords:
      - "Cycle complete"
      - "Dual axis"
      - "Androgynous summation"
      - "Transition to intellect"
      - "Triumph or downfall"
    interpretations: |
      The Ten of Wands concludes the creative/sexual cycle. 
      Instead of a single wand, two or more emerge, forming 
      a gateway or cross that suggests synergy of masculine 
      and feminine energies. This total realisation of 
      creative power may lead one to higher planes 
      (like the Ace of Swords) or flounder if clung to 
      as an end in itself. 
      
      One must release the illusions of possession 
      and let the newly forged energy flow into new realms.
    description: |
      Often, the Ten of Wands shows a pivotal shift: 
      a vertical staff or axis breaks into multiple lines, 
      forming a shape reminiscent of an angel, a cross, 
      or a portal. Leaves might be minimal, implying 
      that the bloom is over— only the final union remains.
    reading: |
      In a reading, the Ten of Wands proclaims the end 
      of a cycle. Recognise the magnitude of your 
      creative or sexual journey, then redirect 
      your impetus to an evolved goal—be it 
      intellectual, spiritual, or humanitarian.
    monologue: |
      "I bear the fruit of all your passion, 
      pressed into a new shape—two wands bridging 
      heaven and earth. Our dance has reached 
      its zenith; step now into the next realm, 
      unburdened by old illusions."
