They are the pages, knights, queens, and kings who guide us through the realms of intellect (Swords), emotion (Cups), creativity and desire (Wands), and material existence (Pentacles). Each Court Card offers insights into character, interpersonal dynamics, and the evolution from youthful potential to fully realised maturity.
